The operation of several university course terms as arms of a randomized controlled trial may also constitute stretching the meaning of the RCT concept. In particular, there is a possibility that students in successive terms heard about the personal experiences of students in previous terms (either positive or negative), which influenced their decision to enroll in the course in later terms. This potential selection bias could lead to contamination of the later terms, weakening the strength of clausal inferences generated by this intervention research project. Nonetheless, educator researchers have a responsibility to construct the most valid and reliable research project they can, given the resources available to them. Given the difficulty of participant recruitment, this RCT structure appears to constitute a suitable and accessible option.
