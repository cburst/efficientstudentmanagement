1. Preposition errors: !1! - "related with" should be "related to."

2. Morphology errors: #1# - "circuit's" should be "circuits'."

3. Determiner errors: €2€ - "the different research area" should be "a different research area," and "signal-processing area" should be "the signal-processing area."

4. Tense/Aspect errors: %3% - "is measured" should be "was measured," "has deeply related" should be "is deeply related," and "mentioned" should be "mention."

5. Agreement errors: ^0^

6. Syntax errors: &3& - "Especially for the system analysis article, commonly explains mechanism and principle about it in signal-processing prospect" needs rephrasing, "what is the efficient method" should be "what the efficient method is," and "needs to more further discussion" should be "more discussion is needed."

7. Punctuation errors: £2£ - A comma is needed after "area," and "signal processing" should be hyphenated as "signal-processing."

8. Spelling errors: ~0~

9. Unidiomatic errors: +2+ - "Studying about" should be "studying," and the sentence "Especially for the system analysis article, commonly explains mechanism and principle about it in signal-processing prospect" is unidiomatic.
