Revised text with corrections:

To create a lighter model, we aim to identify and eliminate the parts of the motion module that contribute the most to latency. In [3], where pruning was applied to the Stable Diffusion model, latency was measured not based on neurons or layers in a neural network but on transformer-based blocks, and unnecessary components were removed accordingly. To prune the motion module, we employed two approaches. First, we examined the structure of the motion module to identify units for pruning. As shown on the right, the motion module is composed of multiple layers within each block. To determine which units to prune, we measured the cosine similarity between the input and output based on transformer blocks and transformer layers. The underlying assumption here is that unnecessary components will have a high cosine similarity between their input and output. The results of the cosine similarity between the input and output are shown in image (B). Specifically, (1) Transformer Temporal Model has similarity values ranging from 0.6 to 0.93, whereas (2) Basic Transformer Block has similarity values ranging from 0.15 to 0.53, and (3) has values ranging from 0.02 to 0.51, which are relatively low. This suggests that the Transformer Block may have considerable redundancy. In practice, removing several blocks of (1) resulted in superior video generation performance compared to removing fewer blocks of the small motion attention in (3). As shown in image C, the quality of the generated video significantly degrades when only one attention block is removed. To determine how many attention blocks to remove, we decided to delete blocks one by one from the original motion module and evaluate the performance. Since the motion module has a total of 21 blocks, this results in 21 variations of the module after deletion. By measuring the FVD (Frechet Video Distance) of the videos generated by the original motion module and those generated after deleting each block, we aim to assess how the video changes with block removal. The assumption is that the more the video changes—i.e., the higher the FVD—the more important the removed block is considered to be. Layers were deleted sequentially, and distillation was performed using the data. The performance at that time was checked to determine the level up to which layers should be deleted.","<total_errors:10><preposition_errors:0><morphology_errors:0><determiner_errors:0><tense-aspect_errors:0><agreement_errors:0><syntax_errors:4><punctuation_errors:3><spelling_errors:0><unidiomatic_errors:2><multiple_errors:0><miscellaneous_errors:1>","<certainty:85>","<total_errors:9><preposition_errors:0><morphology_errors:0><determiner_errors:0><tense-aspect_errors:0><agreement_errors:0><syntax_errors:3><punctuation_errors:3><spelling_errors:0><unidiomatic_errors:2><multiple_errors:0><miscellaneous_errors:1>","1. **Preposition Error**:  
   - ""contribute in lessening pain"" should be ""contribute to lessening pain."" The correct preposition to use with ""contribute"" is ""to.""

2. **Determiner Errors**:  
   - ""significant interests"" should be ""significant interest."" The word ""interest"" is uncountable in this context, so it does not need a determiner indicating plurality.
   - ""a compound annual growth rate"" should be ""at a compound annual growth rate."" The determiner ""a"" is correct, but it was missing the preposition ""at"" before it.

3. **Agreement Errors**:  
   - ""which collects and analyzes"" should be ""which collect and analyze."" The subject ""devices"" is plural, so the verbs should also be plural.
   - ""bio-data is increasing"" should be ""bio-data are increasing."" The term ""data"" is plural, so the verb should be ""are.""
   - ""who needs to continuously monitor"" should be ""who need to continuously monitor."" The subject ""patients"" is plural, so the verb should be ""need.""

4. **Punctuation Errors**:  
   - ""device platforms because I want"" should be ""device platforms, because I want."" A comma is needed before ""because"" to separate the clauses.
   - ""other than blood, will help"" should be ""other than blood will help."" The comma is unnecessary and disrupts the sentence flow.
   - ""methods per different biofluids"" should be ""methods for different biofluids."" The preposition ""for"" is more appropriate than ""per"" in this context.

5. **Unidiomatic Errors**:  
   - ""lessening pain of the patients"" should be ""lessening the pain of patients."" The phrase is more idiomatic with ""the pain of patients.""
   - ""contribute to resolve the issues"" should be ""contribute to resolving the issues."" The phrase ""contribute to"" is followed by a gerund.

6. **Miscellaneous Error**:  
   - ""grow a compound annual growth rate"" should be ""grow at a compound annual growth rate."" The phrase is awkward and needs the preposition ""at"" to be correct.","Wearable biosensors have gained significant interest along with the introduction of commercial wearable smart devices such as the Apple Watch, which collect and analyze biological data such as sleeping patterns and heart rate.
