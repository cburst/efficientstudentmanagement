"2024321543","Wearable biosensors have gained significant interest along with the introduction of commercial wearable smart devices such as the Apple Watch, which collect and analyze biological data such as sleeping patterns and heart rate. With the growing market exposure of wearable devices, demand and expectations for wearable biosensors to collect and analyze more sophisticated bio-data are increasing, especially in measuring continuous glucose levels, which are crucial for successful diabetic management. The global market for wearable glucose monitoring devices is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of around 12.89% [1]. I have chosen the field of wearable biosensors, especially in developing minimal or non-invasive device platforms, because I want to study and conduct research in a field where I can contribute to lessening the pain of patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes, who need to continuously monitor their condition every day. I believe that creating a wearable biosensor that detects alternative biofluids other than blood will help many patients with diabetes suffering from pain caused by traditional finger stick tests. However, detecting glucose in biofluids other than blood is challenging due to low sensitivity and accuracy issues [2]. Therefore, improving sensors by adopting novel designs, materials, and fabrication methods for different biofluids can be one of the areas where I could contribute to resolving the issues related to minimal or non-invasive wearable biosensors.","The text is generally well-written, but there are a few areas where clarity and grammatical accuracy can be improved:

1. **Punctuation Error**: In the sentence ""In [3], where pruning was applied to the Stable Diffusion model, latency was measured not based on neurons or layers in a neural network, but on transformer-based blocks, and unnecessary components were removed accordingly,"" the comma before ""and unnecessary components"" is unnecessary. It should be removed for better flow.

2. **Syntax Error**: The phrase ""As shown on the right, the motion module is composed of multiple layers within each block"" could be clearer. Consider rephrasing to ""The motion module, as shown on the right, is composed of multiple layers within each block.""

3. **Unidiomatic Expression**: The phrase ""The results of cosine similarity between input and output are shown in image (B)"" could be more idiomatic. Consider rephrasing to ""The cosine similarity results between input and output are shown in image (B).""

4. **Punctuation Error**: In the sentence ""Specifically, (1) Transformer Temporal Model has similarity values ranging from 0.6 to 0.93, whereas (2) Basic Transformer Block has similarity values ranging from 0.15 to 0.53, and (3) has values ranging from 0.02 to 0.51, which are relatively low,"" the list format is a bit confusing. Consider using a clearer list format or rephrasing for clarity.

5. **Syntax Error**: The sentence ""In practice, when several blocks of (1) were removed, the performance in video generation was superior compared to removing fewer blocks of the small motion attention in (3)"" could be clearer. Consider rephrasing to ""In practice, removing several blocks of (1) resulted in superior video generation performance compared to removing fewer blocks of the small motion attention in (3).""

6. **Punctuation Error**: In the sentence ""As can be seen in image C, the quality of the generated video is significantly degraded when only one attention block is removed,"" the comma after ""As can be seen in image C"" is correct, but ensure consistency in referring to images (e.g., ""image C"" vs. ""image (B)"").

7. **Syntax Error**: The sentence ""The performance at that time was checked to determine the level up to which layers should be deleted"" could be clearer. Consider rephrasing to ""The performance was checked at each stage to determine up to which level layers should be deleted.""

Overall, the text is informative and well-structured, but these adjustments can enhance clarity and readability.","<total_errors:12><preposition_errors:1><morphology_errors:0><determiner_errors:2><tense-aspect_errors:0><agreement_errors:3><syntax_errors:1><punctuation_errors:3><spelling_errors:0><unidiomatic_errors:1><multiple_errors:1><miscellaneous_errors:0>","<total_errors:7><preposition_errors:0><morphology_errors:0><determiner_errors:0><tense-aspect_errors:0><agreement_errors:0><syntax_errors:3><punctuation_errors:3><spelling_errors:0><unidiomatic_errors:1><multiple_errors:0><miscellaneous_errors:0>","<certainty:95>","<certainty:95>","<total_errors:11><preposition_errors:1><morphology_errors:0><determiner_errors:2><tense-aspect_errors:0><agreement_errors:3><syntax_errors:0><punctuation_errors:3><spelling_errors:0><unidiomatic_errors:1><multiple_errors:1><miscellaneous_errors:0>","<total_errors:7><preposition_errors:0><morphology_errors:0><determiner_errors:0><tense-aspect_errors:0><agreement_errors:0><syntax_errors:3><punctuation_errors:3><spelling_errors:0><unidiomatic_errors:1><multiple_errors:0><miscellaneous_errors:0>","1. **Preposition Error**: ""contribute in lessening"" should be ""contribute to lessening."" The correct preposition to use with ""contribute"" is ""to.""

2. **Determiner Errors**: 
   - ""significant interests"" should be ""significant interest."" The word ""interest"" is uncountable in this context, so it does not need a determiner indicating plurality.
   - ""a compound annual growth rate"" should be ""at a compound annual growth rate."" The determiner ""at"" is needed to correctly phrase the growth rate.

3. **Agreement Errors**:
   - ""which collects and analyzes"" should be ""which collect and analyze"" to agree with the plural subject ""devices.""
   - ""is increasing"" should be ""are increasing"" to agree with the plural subject ""demand and expectations.""
   - ""who needs to continuously monitor"" should be ""who need to continuously monitor"" to agree with the plural subject ""patients.""

4. **Punctuation Errors**:
   - ""device platforms because"" should have a comma after ""platforms"" to separate the dependent clause: ""device platforms, because.""
   - ""other than blood, will help"" should not have a comma after ""blood"" because it separates the subject from the verb unnecessarily.
   - ""Therefore, improving sensors by adopting novel designs, materials, and fabrication methods per different biofluids can be one of the areas that I could contribute to resolve the issues related to minimal or non-invasive wearable biosensors."" This sentence is quite long and could benefit from breaking into two sentences for clarity, but the main punctuation issue is the lack of a comma after ""Therefore.""

5. **Unidiomatic Error**: ""contribute in lessening pain of the patients"" should be ""contribute to lessening the pain of patients."" The phrase ""lessening the pain of patients"" is more idiomatic.

6. **Multiple Errors**: The sentence ""Therefore, improving sensors by adopting novel designs, materials, and fabrication methods per different biofluids can be one of the areas that I could contribute to resolve the issues related to minimal or non-invasive wearable biosensors."" contains multiple issues, including punctuation and unidiomatic phrasing, making it difficult to categorize under a single error type.","Wearable biosensors have gained significant interest along with the introduction of commercial wearable smart devices such as the Apple Watch, which collect and analyze biological data such as sleeping patterns and heart rate.
