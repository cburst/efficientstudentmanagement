Wearable biosensors gained significant interests along with the introduction of commercial wearable smart devices such as the Apple Watch, which collects and analyzes biological data such as sleeping patterns and heart rate. With the growing market exposure of wearable devices, demand and expectations for wearable biosensors to collect and analyze more sophisticated bio-data is increasing, especially in measuring continuous glucose levels, which is crucial for successful diabetic management. The global market for wearable glucose monitoring devices is expected to grow a compound annual growth rate of around 12.89% [1]. I have chosen the field of wearable biosensors, especially in developing minimal or non-invasive device platforms because I want to study and conduct research in a field where I can contribute in lessening pain of the patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes, who needs to continuously monitor their disease every day. I believe that creating a wearable biosensor that detects alternative biofluids other than blood, will help many patients with diabetes suffering from pain caused by traditional finger stick tests. However, detecting glucose in biofluids other than blood is challenging due to the low sensitivity and accuracy issues [2]. Therefore, improving sensors by adopting novel designs, materials, and fabrication methods per different biofluids can be one of the areas that I could contribute to resolve the issues related to minimal or non-invasive wearable biosensors.
