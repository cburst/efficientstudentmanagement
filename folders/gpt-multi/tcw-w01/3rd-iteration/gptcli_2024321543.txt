You are trying to help English language learners improve the grammatical accuracy of their writing. A grammar error is any issue within a sentence that makes it difficult to understand. Punctuation errors are related to the incorrect use of punctuation marks (e.g., periods, commas, semicolons, quotation marks) in sentences. Syntax errors involve issues with sentence structure or word order. Preposition errors involve the incorrect use of prepositions, which are words that show the relationship between nouns or pronouns and other elements in a sentence (e.g., “in,” “on,” “at,” “by”). Tense/aspect errors are related to the incorrect use of verb tenses (past, present, future) or aspects (e.g., progressive, perfect), which indicate the time and duration of an action. Spelling errors involve the incorrect spelling of words. Unidiomatic errors occur where phrases or expressions were not used in a natural or standard way according to the conventions of the language. Agreement errors involve the lack of agreement between subject and verb (subject-verb agreement) or between nouns and pronouns (pronoun-antecedent agreement). Determiner errors are related to the incorrect use of determiners (e.g., “a,” “an,” “the,” “some,” “this”) that introduce nouns. Morphology errors involve the incorrect formation or inflection of words, including issues with prefixes, suffixes, or word roots. Miscellaneous errors are those that do not fit neatly into other categories, often including a variety of uncommon or unique issues. Multiple errors are instances where more than one type of error occurs in the same sentence or phrase, making it difficult to categorize under a single error type.'}]}

Please check for any grammar errors in the following text: Wearable biosensors gained significant interests along with the introduction of commercial wearable smart devices such as the Apple Watch, which collects and analyzes biological data such as sleeping patterns and heart rate. With the growing market exposure of wearable devices, demand and expectations for wearable biosensors to collect and analyze more sophisticated bio-data is increasing, especially in measuring continuous glucose levels, which is crucial for successful diabetic management. The global market for wearable glucose monitoring devices is expected to grow a compound annual growth rate of around 12.89% [1]. I have chosen the field of wearable biosensors, especially in developing minimal or non-invasive device platforms because I want to study and conduct research in a field where I can contribute in lessening pain of the patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes, who needs to continuously monitor their disease every day. I believe that creating a wearable biosensor that detects alternative biofluids other than blood, will help many patients with diabetes suffering from pain caused by traditional finger stick tests. However, detecting glucose in biofluids other than blood is challenging due to the low sensitivity and accuracy issues [2]. Therefore, improving sensors by adopting novel designs, materials, and fabrication methods per different biofluids can be one of the areas that I could contribute to resolve the issues related to minimal or non-invasive wearable biosensors.

1. **Preposition Error**:  
   - "contribute in lessening pain" should be "contribute to lessening pain." The correct preposition to use with "contribute" is "to."

2. **Determiner Error**:  
   - "a compound annual growth rate of around 12.89%" should be "at a compound annual growth rate of around 12.89%." The determiner "at" is needed to correctly introduce the rate.

3. **Agreement Errors**:  
   - "Wearable biosensors gained significant interests" should be "Wearable biosensors have gained significant interest." The verb tense should be present perfect to indicate an ongoing action, and "interest" should be singular.
   - "demand and expectations for wearable biosensors to collect and analyze more sophisticated bio-data is increasing" should be "are increasing." The subject "demand and expectations" is plural, so the verb should be "are."
   - "patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes, who needs to continuously monitor" should be "who need to continuously monitor." The subject "patients" is plural, so the verb should be "need."

4. **Punctuation Errors**:  
   - "device platforms because I want to study" should have a comma after "platforms" to separate the clauses: "device platforms, because I want to study."
   - "other than blood, will help" should not have a comma: "other than blood will help." The comma is unnecessary and disrupts the flow of the sentence.
   - "Therefore, improving sensors by adopting novel designs, materials, and fabrication methods per different biofluids can be one of the areas that I could contribute to resolve the issues" should have a comma after "biofluids": "Therefore, improving sensors by adopting novel designs, materials, and fabrication methods, per different biofluids, can be one of the areas where I could contribute to resolving the issues."
   - "to resolve the issues" should be "to resolving the issues." The gerund form "resolving" is needed after "contribute to."

5. **Unidiomatic Error**:  
   - "contribute in lessening pain" is unidiomatic. The phrase should be "contribute to lessening the pain" to sound more natural.

6. **Miscellaneous Error**:  
   - "minimal or non-invasive device platforms" should be "minimally or non-invasive device platforms." The adverb "minimally" is needed to modify "invasive."
