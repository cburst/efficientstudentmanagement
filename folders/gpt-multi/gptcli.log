"For the last two years and several months, all people have been suffering from COVID-19 itself and the related effects of the disease. The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread.

Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

2024-08-25 10:08:38,960 - gptcli-session - INFO - assistant: I apologize for any oversight. Let's carefully review the paragraph again for any additional errors:

Original paragraph:
"Several epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene variants are highly associated with many cancers [ref] including non-small cell lung cancer, which is the second-most common lung cancer type worldwide [ref]. Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results."

Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

Revised paragraph:
For the last two years and several months, people have been suffering from COVID-19 and its related effects. When COVID-19 first occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even had their privacy intruded upon for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms are from the flu. However, now, the response to COVID-19 has faced new conditions. Although the two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that the two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulations for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage COVID-19 variants and future pandemics.

Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else.

Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right.

1. **Syntax error**: "say, A punches another person, say, B" should be "say, A, punches another person, say, B".
2. **Punctuation error**: "B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong" should be "B’s action was not polite and, accordingly, may be morally wrong".
3. **Determiner error**: "this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action" should be "this reason may not be sufficient to justify A’s violent action".
4. **Agreement error**: "the person who conducts violent action" should be "the person who conducts a violent action".

6. **Syntax error**: "War seems like an extended case of violent action" should be "War seems like an extended case of violent actions".

8. **Unidiomatic error**: "the subject of war cannot be specified" should be "the parties involved in a war cannot be specified".

Revised paragraph:

War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A, punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite and, accordingly, may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient to justify A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts a violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve the unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent actions. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone?

Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

Revised paragraph:
For the last two years and several months, everyone has been suffering from COVID-19 itself and its related effects. The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even had their privacy intruded upon for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media explained how different COVID-19 symptoms are from the flu. However, now, the response to COVID-19 has faced a new situation. Although the two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that the two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulations for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemic variants.

Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified.

1. **Syntax error**: "one person, say, A punches another person, say, B" should be "one person, say, A, punches another person, say, B" to correctly set off the phrase "say, A" with commas.
2. **Syntax error**: "B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong" should be "B’s action was not polite and, accordingly, may be morally wrong" to correctly place the commas around "accordingly."
3. **Syntax error**: "Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else" should be "Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts the violent action was already under attack from someone else" to include the definite article "the."
4. **Syntax error**: "A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation" should be "A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstances with conversation" to use the plural form "circumstances."
5. **Syntax error**: "Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack?" should be "Is starting a war justified only in the case that the country which starts a war was already under attack?" to include the definite article "the."
6. **Agreement error**: "the subject of war cannot be specified" should be "the subjects of war cannot be specified" to match the plural form "subjects" with the plural context of war involving multiple parties.

Revised paragraph:

War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A, punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite and, accordingly, may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts the violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstances with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in the case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subjects of war cannot be specified.

2024-08-25 10:35:20,549 - gptcli-session - INFO - assistant: I apologize for any oversight. Let's carefully re-examine the paragraph for any additional errors:

Original paragraph:
"War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong.

Upon re-examination, I found additional errors:

6. **Agreement error**: "the subject of war cannot be specified" should be "the subjects of war cannot be specified" to match the plural form "subjects" with the plural context of war involving multiple parties. (^1^)
7. **Syntax error**: "Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action" should be "Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient to justify A’s violent action" to use the correct infinitive form. (&4&)
8. **Syntax error**: "Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries" should be "Starting a war is a violent action not between individuals, but between countries" to remove the unnecessary comma. (&5&)
9. **Syntax error**: "Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack?" should be "Is starting a war justified only in the case that the country that starts a war was already under attack?" to use "that" instead of "which" for restrictive clauses. (&6&)

Revised paragraph:
War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A, punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite and, accordingly, may be morally wrong.

Syntax errors involve issues with sentence structure or word order. Preposition errors involve the incorrect use of prepositions, which are words that show the relationship between nouns or pronouns and other elements in a sentence (e.g., “in,” “on,” “at,” “by”). Tense/aspect errors are related to the incorrect use of verb tenses (past, present, future) or aspects (e.g., progressive, perfect), which indicate the time and duration of an action. Spelling errors involve the incorrect spelling of words. Unidiomatic errors occur where phrases or expressions were not used in a natural or standard way according to the conventions of the language. Agreement errors involve the lack of agreement between subject and verb (subject-verb agreement) or between nouns and pronouns (pronoun-antecedent agreement).

Agreement errors involve the lack of agreement between subject and verb (subject-verb agreement) or between nouns and pronouns (pronoun-antecedent agreement). Determiner errors are related to the incorrect use of determiners (e.g., “a,” “an,” “the,” “some,” “this”) that introduce nouns. Morphology errors involve the incorrect formation or inflection of words, including issues with prefixes, suffixes, or word roots.

Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified.

Original paragraph:
Several epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene variants are highly associated with many cancers [ref] including non-small cell lung cancer, which is the second-most common lung cancer type worldwide [ref]. Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways.

In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right.

Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

2024-08-25 10:43:05,960 - gptcli-session - INFO - user: Can you check the following paragraph, located after the colon, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph: War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified.

For instance, one person, say, A, punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite and may accordingly be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient to justify A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B.

Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

Revised paragraph:
For the last two years and several months, everyone has been suffering from COVID-19 itself and the related effects of the disease. The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the spread of the disease. The earliest infected people even had their privacy intruded upon for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms are from the flu. However, now, the response to COVID-19 has encountered a new situation. Although the two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that the two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulations for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 as well as future pandemics.

There are @8@ grammar mistakes in the paragraph. Here is the explanation for each mistake and the revised paragraph:

1. **Syntax error**: "say, A punches another person, say, B" should be "say, A, punches another person, say, B". (&)
2. **Syntax error**: "B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong" should be "B’s action was not polite and may, accordingly, be morally wrong". (&)
3. **Syntax error**: "Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action" should be "Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient to justify A’s violent action". (&)
4. **Syntax error**: "Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else" should be "Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts the violent action is already under attack from someone else". (&)
5. **Syntax error**: "A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation" should be "A could have attempted to resolve the unpleasant circumstance with conversation". (&)
6. **Syntax error**: "Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack?" should be "Is starting a war justified only if the country that starts the war is already under attack?". (&)
7. **Unidiomatic error**: "I don’t believe that this is right" should be "I don’t believe this is right". (+)
8. **Syntax error**: "the subject of war cannot be specified" should be "the subject of war cannot be as easily specified". (&)

Revised paragraph:
War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A, punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite and may, accordingly, be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient to justify A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts the violent action is already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve the unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only if the country that starts the war is already under attack? I don’t believe this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be as easily specified.

Revised paragraph:
Several epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene variants are highly associated with many cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, which is the second-most common lung cancer type worldwide [ref]. Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision-making for cancer treatment, and improved prognoses for patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation: RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from patients’ blood draws, have become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study suggests using nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to better reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries.

Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

Revised paragraph:
For the last two years and several months, everyone has been suffering from COVID-19 and its related effects. When COVID-19 first occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even had their privacy intruded upon for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media highlighted how different COVID-19 symptoms are from the flu. However, now, the response to COVID-19 has faced new conditions. Although the two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that the two diseases are extremely manageable for reasonably healthy people by simply eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to become less aggressive regarding regulations for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

2024-08-29 18:02:47,210 - gptcli-session - INFO - user: War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19.

1. **Syntax error**: "all people" should be "people" for a more natural expression.
2. **Syntax error**: "the first time COVID-19 occurred" should be "when COVID-19 first occurred" for better clarity.
3. **Preposition error**: "confused about finding" should be "confused in finding" for correct preposition use.
4. **Unidiomatic error**: "got intruded on their privacy" should be "had their privacy intruded upon" for a more natural expression.
5. **Syntax error**: "how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are" should be "how different COVID-19 symptoms are from the flu" for correct word order.
6. **Syntax error**: "action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition" should be "actions against COVID-19 have faced new conditions" for subject-verb agreement and clarity.
7. **Determiner error**: "two diseases" should be "the two diseases" for correct use of the determiner.
8. **Syntax error**: "less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19" should be "less aggressive in regulating COVID-19" for correct word order and preposition use.

Revised paragraph:
For the last two years and several months, people have been suffering from COVID-19 itself and the related effects of the disease. When COVID-19 first occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused in finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even had their privacy intruded upon for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms are from the flu. However, now, actions against COVID-19 have faced new conditions. Although the two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that the two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive in regulating COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else.

Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries.

Revised paragraph:

War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A, punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite and, accordingly, may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but A still shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts a violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve their unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in the case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subjects of war cannot be specified.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right.

Revised paragraph:

For the last two years and several months, everyone has been suffering from COVID-19 itself and the related effects of the disease. When COVID-19 first occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused in finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even had their privacy intruded upon for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms are from the flu. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although the two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that the two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to be less aggressive in regulating COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and may accordingly be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient to justify A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts the violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance through conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only if the country that starts the war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified clearly.

5. **Preposition error**: "resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation" should be "resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance through conversation."
   - !1!

6. **Syntax error**: "Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack?" should be "Is starting a war justified only if the country that starts the war was already under attack?"

7. **Determiner error**: "the subject of war cannot be specified" should be "the subject of war cannot be specified clearly."

8. **Syntax error**: "Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action" should be "Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient to justify A’s violent action."
   - &4&

**Revised paragraph:**

War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and may accordingly be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient to justify A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts the violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance through conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only if the country that starts the war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified clearly.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

1. **Repetition**: The paragraph is repeated multiple times. This is not a grammatical error per se, but it affects readability and coherence.
2. **Punctuation**: "Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action." - A comma should be added after "Nonetheless".
3. **Punctuation**: "B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B." - A comma should be added after "still".
4. **Syntax**: "Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else." - This sentence is awkward. It can be rephrased for clarity.
5. **Preposition**: "A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation." - "with" should be "through".
6. **Syntax**: "Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack?" - "in case that" should be "if".
7. **Agreement**: "Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified." - "the subject of war" should be "the subjects of war".
8. **Repetition**: The entire paragraph is repeated four times, which is unnecessary.

Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients.

Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

**Explanation of mistakes:**

1. **Repetition**: The entire paragraph is repeated multiple times. This is not a grammatical error per se, but it is a significant issue that affects readability and coherence.
2. **Punctuation**: "Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action." - A comma should be added after "Nonetheless".

**Revised paragraph:**

War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A, punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite and may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still, A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who commits a violent act was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve their unpleasant circumstance through conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only if the country that starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the parties involved in a war cannot be specified.

The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition.

**Explanation of mistakes:**

1. **Repetition**: The paragraph is repeated multiple times, which is unnecessary and makes it difficult to read.
2. **Punctuation Error**: "Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action." - A comma should be added after "Nonetheless".
3. **Syntax Error**: "Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else." - "was" should be "is" to maintain consistency in tense.
4. **Preposition Error**: "A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation." - "with" should be "through".
5. **Syntax Error**: "Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack?" - "in case that" should be "if".
6. **Agreement Error**: "Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified." - "the subject of war" should be "the subjects of war" to match the plural context.

**Revised Paragraph:**

War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action is already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance through conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only if the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subjects of war cannot be specified.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

Revised paragraph:
For the last two years and several months, all people have been suffering from COVID-19 and its related effects. When COVID-19 first emerged, the Korean government and citizens were confused about how to effectively trace and prevent the spread of the disease. The earliest infected people even had their privacy intruded upon for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how COVID-19 symptoms differ from the flu. However, now, the response to COVID-19 has encountered a new situation. Although the two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022).

**Explanation of mistakes:**

1. **Repetition**: The entire paragraph is repeated multiple times. This is not a grammatical error per se, but it is a significant issue that affects readability and coherence.
2. **Punctuation**: "Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action." - A comma should be added after "Nonetheless".
3. **Agreement**: "B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B." - The phrase "B did wrong" is unidiomatic. It should be "B was wrong".
4. **Syntax**: "Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else." - This sentence is awkward. It can be rephrased for clarity.
5. **Preposition**: "A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation." - The preposition "with" is awkward here. It should be "through conversation".
6. **Syntax**: "Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack?" - The phrase "in case that" is unidiomatic. It should be "in the case that".
7. **Determiner**: "Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified." - The phrase "the subject of war" is vague. It should be "the parties involved in a war".
8. **Repetition**: The phrase "War can never be morally justified" is repeated unnecessarily.
9. **Syntax**: "Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action." - The phrase "for justifying" is awkward. It should be "to justify".
10. **Agreement**: "the country which starts a war was already under attack" - The phrase "the country which starts a war" is awkward. It should be "the country that starts a war".

**Revised Paragraph:**

War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A, punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite and may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient to justify A’s violent action. B was wrong, but still, A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts the violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance through conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in the case that the country that starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the parties involved in a war cannot be specified.

**Explanation of categorized errors:**

1. **Preposition errors** (!1!):
   - "A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation." - The preposition "with" is awkward here. It should be "through conversation".

2. **Morphology errors** (#0#):
   - No morphology errors were found.

3. **Determiner errors** (€1€):
   - "Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified." - The phrase "the subject of war" is vague. It should be "the parties involved in a war".

4. **Tense/Aspect errors** (%0%):
   - No tense/aspect errors were found.

5. **Agreement errors** (^2^):
   - "B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B." - The phrase "B did wrong" is unidiomatic. It should be "B was wrong".
   - "the country which starts a war was already under attack" - The phrase "the country which starts a war" is awkward. It should be "the country that starts a war".

6. **Syntax errors** (&4&):
   - "Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action." - The phrase "for justifying" is awkward. It should be "to justify".
   - "Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else." - This sentence is awkward. It can be rephrased for clarity.
   - "Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack?" - The phrase "in case that" is unidiomatic. It should be "in the case that".
   - Repetition of the entire paragraph multiple times.

7. **Punctuation errors** (£1£):
   - "Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action." - A comma should be added after "Nonetheless".

8. **Spelling errors** (~0~):
   - No spelling errors were found.

9. **Unidiomatic errors** (+1+):
   - "B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B." - The phrase "B did wrong" is unidiomatic. It should be "B was wrong".

10. **Multiple errors** (=0=):
    - No multiple errors were found.

**Revised Paragraph:**

War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A, punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite and may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient to justify A’s violent action. B was wrong, but still, A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts the violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance through conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in the case that the country that starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the parties involved in a war cannot be specified.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

**Explanation of mistakes:**

1. **Repetition**: The paragraph is repeated multiple times, which is unnecessary and makes it difficult to read.
2. **Punctuation Error**: "Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action." - A comma should be added after "Nonetheless".
3. **Syntax Error**: "Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else." - "was" should be changed to "is" to maintain present tense consistency.
4. **Preposition Error**: "A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation." - "with" should be changed to "through" for better idiomatic usage.
5. **Syntax Error**: "Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack?" - "in case that" should be changed to "if".
6. **Agreement Error**: "Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified." - "the subject of war" should be "the subjects of war" to match the plural context.
7. **Punctuation Error**: "War can never be morally justified." - This sentence is repeated unnecessarily at the beginning of each repeated paragraph.
8. **Miscellaneous Error**: The entire paragraph is repeated multiple times, which is not necessary and should be corrected.

**Revised Paragraph:**

War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action is already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance through conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only if the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subjects of war cannot be specified.

Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

1. **Syntax error**: "For the last two years and several months" is awkward. It would be clearer to say "For the past two years and several months."
2. **Unidiomatic error**: "all people" should be "everyone."
3. **Syntax error**: "COVID-19 itself and the related effects of the disease" is redundant. "COVID-19 and its related effects" is more concise.
4. **Preposition error**: "The first time COVID-19 occurred" should be "When COVID-19 first occurred."
5. **Syntax error**: "got intruded on their privacy" should be "had their privacy intruded upon."
6. **Syntax error**: "how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are" should be "how COVID-19 symptoms differ from the flu."
7. **Syntax error**: "action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition" should be "the response to COVID-19 has faced new conditions."
8. **Determiner error**: "two diseases" should be "the two diseases."

Revised paragraph:

For the past two years and several months, everyone has been suffering from COVID-19 and its related effects. When COVID-19 first occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even had their privacy intruded upon for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how COVID-19 symptoms differ from the flu. However, now, the response to COVID-19 has faced new conditions. Although the two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that the two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

2024-08-29 20:24:24,972 - gptcli-session - INFO - user: Several epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene variants are highly associated with many cancers [ref] including non-small cell lung cancer, which is the second-most common lung cancer type worldwide [ref]. Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B.

B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right.

The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition.

From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19.

Revised paragraph:

Several epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene variants are highly associated with many cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, which is the second-most common lung cancer type worldwide. Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision-making for cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation: the RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, have become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in forms similar to cfDNA. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

2024-08-29 20:32:34,504 - gptcli-session - INFO - user: Several epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene variants are highly associated with many cancers [ref] including non-small cell lung cancer, which is the second-most common lung cancer type worldwide [ref]. Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

Several epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene variants are highly associated with many cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, which is the second-most common lung cancer type worldwide. Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision-making for cancer treatment, and improved patient prognosis. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

Revised paragraph:
For the last two years and several months, everyone has been suffering from COVID-19 and its related effects. When COVID-19 first occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even had their privacy intruded upon for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms are from the flu. However, now, the response to COVID-19 has faced a new situation. Although the two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that the two diseases are extremely manageable for reasonably healthy people by simply eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to become less aggressive in regulating COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage COVID-19 variants and future pandemics.

Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies.

Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

For instance, one person, say, A, punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still, A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in the case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subjects of war cannot be specified.

Revised Paragraph:

War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A, punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still, A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in the case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subjects of war cannot be specified.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19.

Number of grammar mistakes: **@8@**

1. **Syntax error**: "For the last two years and several months" is awkward. It would be clearer to say "For the past two years and several months."
2. **Unidiomatic error**: "all people" should be "everyone."
3. **Syntax error**: "COVID-19 itself and the related effects of the disease" is redundant. "COVID-19 and its related effects" is more concise.
4. **Syntax error**: "The first time COVID-19 occurred" should be "When COVID-19 first occurred."
5. **Preposition error**: "confused about finding" should be "confused in finding."
6. **Unidiomatic error**: "got intruded on their privacy" should be "had their privacy intruded upon."
7. **Syntax error**: "how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are" should be "how different COVID-19 symptoms are from the flu."
8. **Agreement error**: "two diseases are extremely manageable" should be "the two diseases are extremely manageable."

Revised paragraph:

For the past two years and several months, everyone has been suffering from COVID-19 and its related effects. When COVID-19 first occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused in finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even had their privacy intruded upon for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms are from the flu. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although the two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that the two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

Revised Paragraph:
```
War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A, punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite and, accordingly, may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient to justify A’s violent action. B did wrong, but A still shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who commits the violent action was already under attack by someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance through conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only if the country that starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified. War can never be morally justified.

Tense/aspect errors are related to the incorrect use of verb tenses (past, present, future) or aspects (e.g., progressive, perfect), which indicate the time and duration of an action. Spelling errors involve the incorrect spelling of words. Unidiomatic errors occur where phrases or expressions were not used in a natural or standard way according to the conventions of the language. Agreement errors involve the lack of agreement between subject and verb (subject-verb agreement) or between nouns and pronouns (pronoun-antecedent agreement). Determiner errors are related to the incorrect use of determiners (e.g., “a,” “an,” “the,” “some,” “this”) that introduce nouns. Morphology errors involve the incorrect formation or inflection of words, including issues with prefixes, suffixes, or word roots. Miscellaneous errors are those that do not fit neatly into other categories, often including a variety of uncommon or unique issues. Multiple errors are instances where more than one type of error occurs in the same sentence or phrase, making it difficult to categorize under a single error type.'}]}

For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right.

Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B.

Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries.

In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right.

The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

2024-08-29 21:55:29,058 - gptcli-session - INFO - user: Several epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene variants are highly associated with many cancers [ref] including non-small cell lung cancer, which is the second-most common lung cancer type worldwide [ref]. Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

Revised paragraph:
Several epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene variants are highly associated with many cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, which is the second-most common lung cancer type worldwide [ref]. Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision-making for cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation: the RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, have become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in forms similar to cfDNA. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study suggests using nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to better reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action.

Number of grammar mistakes: **@6@**

### Explanation of Mistakes:
1. **Syntax Error**: "accordingly may be morally wrong" should be "and may accordingly be morally wrong" for better readability.
2. **Agreement Error**: "B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B." should be "B did wrong, but A still shouldn’t have punched B." for better word order.
3. **Syntax Error**: "the person who conducts violent action" should be "the person who commits the violent action" for more natural phrasing.
4. **Preposition Error**: "resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation" should be "resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance through conversation" for correct preposition use.
5. **Syntax Error**: "Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack?" should be "Is starting a war justified only if the country that starts it was already under attack?" for better readability.
6. **Punctuation Error**: "specified.War" should be "specified. War" to correct the missing space after the period.

### Revised Paragraph:

For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and may accordingly be morally wrong.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right.

Revised paragraph:

Several epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene variants are highly associated with many cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, which is the second-most common lung cancer type worldwide. Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision-making for cancer treatment, and improved prognoses for patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation: the RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, have become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in forms similar to cfDNA. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study suggests using nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to better reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified.

Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

Revised paragraph:
For the past two years and several months, everyone has been suffering from COVID-19 itself and the related effects of the disease. When COVID-19 first emerged, the Korean government and citizens were confused about how to find the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even had their privacy intruded upon for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms are from the flu. However, now, the response to COVID-19 has encountered a new situation. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that the two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulations for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

There are **@8@** grammar mistakes in the paragraph. Here is the explanation for each mistake and a revised version of the paragraph:

1. **Syntax error**: "say, A punches another person, say, B" should be "say, A, punches another person, say, B". (&1&)
2. **Syntax error**: "B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong" should be "B’s action was not polite and may, accordingly, be morally wrong". (&2&)
3. **Syntax error**: "Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action" should be "Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient to justify A’s violent action". (&3&)
4. **Syntax error**: "Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else" should be "Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts the violent action was already under attack from someone else". (&4&)
5. **Syntax error**: "A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation" should be "A could have attempted to resolve the unpleasant circumstance with conversation". (&5&)
6. **Syntax error**: "Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack?" should be "Is starting a war justified only if the country that starts the war was already under attack?". (&6&)
7. **Determiner error**: "the subject of war cannot be specified" should be "the subjects of war cannot be specified". (€1€)
8. **Punctuation error**: "War can never be morally justified" should end with a period. (£1£)

Revised paragraph:

War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A, punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite and may, accordingly, be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient to justify A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still, A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts the violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve the unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only if the country that starts the war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subjects of war cannot be specified.

1. **Punctuation error**: The first sentence should have a comma before "including." (£1£)
2. **Punctuation error**: The first sentence should have a comma before the citation "[ref]." (£2£)
3. **Unidiomatic error**: "decision of cancer treatment" should be "decision-making for cancer treatment." (+1+)
4. **Agreement error**: "improved prognosis of patients" should be "improved prognoses for patients." (^1^)
5. **Syntax error**: "one limitation that RMs consist of" should be "one limitation: RMs consist of." (&1&)
6. **Tense/aspect error**: "become widely used" should be "have become widely used." (%1%)

Revised paragraph:
Several epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene variants are highly associated with many cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, which is the second-most common lung cancer type worldwide [ref]. Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision-making for cancer treatment, and improved prognoses for patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation: RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, have become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study suggests using nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to better reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified.

Here is the revised paragraph with the additional errors identified:

1. **Syntax error**: "For the last two years and several months" is awkward. It would be clearer to say "For the past two years and several months."
2. **Unidiomatic error**: "all people" should be "everyone" for a more natural expression.
3. **Syntax error**: "COVID-19 itself and the related effects of the disease" is redundant. "COVID-19 and its related effects" is more concise.
4. **Preposition error**: "The first time COVID-19 occurred" should be "When COVID-19 first occurred."
5. **Syntax error**: "got intruded on their privacy" should be "had their privacy intruded upon."
6. **Syntax error**: "how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are" should be "how different COVID-19 symptoms are from the flu."
7. **Syntax error**: "action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition" should be "the response to COVID-19 has faced new conditions."
8. **Unidiomatic error**: "get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19" should be "become less aggressive in regulating COVID-19."
9. **Determiner error**: "two diseases" should be "the two diseases" for clarity.
10. **Agreement error**: "two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy" should be "the two diseases are extremely manageable for people who are reasonably healthy."

Revised paragraph:
For the past two years and several months, everyone has been suffering from COVID-19 and its related effects. When COVID-19 first occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even had their privacy intruded upon for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms are from the flu. However, now, the response to COVID-19 has faced new conditions. Although the two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that the two diseases are extremely manageable for people who are reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to become less aggressive in regulating COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

There are **@9@** grammar mistakes in the paragraph. Here is an explanation of each mistake, categorized by error type:

1. **Syntax error**: "one person, say, A punches another person, say, B" should be "one person, say, A, punches another person, say, B" (missing comma after "A"). **&**
2. **Punctuation error**: "B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong" should be "B’s action was not polite and, accordingly, may be morally wrong" (incorrect comma placement). **£**
3. **Syntax error**: "B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B" should be "B did wrong, but A still shouldn’t have punched B" (incorrect word order). **&**
4. **Syntax error**: "the person who conducts violent action" should be "the person who commits violent action" (incorrect verb choice). **&**
5. **Syntax error**: "A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation" should be "A could have attempted to resolve the unpleasant circumstance with conversation" (repetition of "A" is unnecessary). **&**
6. **Syntax error**: "not between individuals, but between countries" should be "not between individuals but between countries" (unnecessary comma). **&**
7. **Syntax error**: "only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack" should be "only if the country that starts a war was already under attack" (incorrect phrase). **&**
8. **Tense/Aspect error**: "the subject of war cannot be specified" should be "the subject of war cannot be as easily specified" (clarification needed for better understanding). **%**
9. **Syntax error**: "War can never be morally justified" should be "War can never be morally justified" (missing period at the end of the sentence). **&**

Revised paragraph:

War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A, punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite and, accordingly, may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but A still shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who commits violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve the unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only if the country that starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be as easily specified.

However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

2024-08-29 23:09:41,503 - gptcli-session - INFO - user: Can you check the following paragraph, located after the colon, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph: War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified.

Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

Revised Paragraph:
For the last two years and several months, everyone has been suffering from COVID-19 and the related effects of the disease. When COVID-19 first emerged, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even had their privacy intruded upon for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media explained how COVID-19 symptoms differ from the flu. However, now, the response to COVID-19 has encountered a new situation. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they say that the two diseases are extremely manageable except for those who are not reasonably healthy, simply by maintaining good eating and sleeping habits (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to become less aggressive in regulating COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified.

Revised paragraph:
War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly, it may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient to justify A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts the violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only if the country that starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the parties involved in a war cannot be specified.

3. **Syntax error**: The phrase "one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA" is awkward. It can be rephrased for clarity.
4. **Tense/aspect error**: The phrase "become widely used" should be in the present perfect tense to indicate an action that started in the past and continues to the present. It should be "have become widely used."

Revised paragraph:
Several epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene variants are highly associated with many cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, which is the second-most common lung cancer type worldwide [ref]. Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, the decision on cancer treatment, and an improved prognosis for patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation: they consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, have become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study suggests using nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to better reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified.

Revised Paragraph:
For the last two years and several months, everyone has been suffering from COVID-19 itself and the related effects of the disease. When COVID-19 first emerged, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even had their privacy intruded upon for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms are from the flu. However, now, the response to COVID-19 is facing a new situation. Although these two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that the two diseases are extremely manageable, except for those who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to become less aggressive in regulating COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries.

Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

2. **Syntax error**: The phrase "decision of cancer treatment" is awkward and unidiomatic.

Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, the selection of cancer treatment, and improved prognoses of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation: they consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA.

Start your answer with a line containing only the number of mistakes between two @ symbols. Here is the paragraph: War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified.

1. **Syntax error**: "For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A." - The phrase "say, A punches" should be "say, A, punches" to correctly set off the name with commas.
2. **Syntax error**: "Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action." - The phrase "for justifying" is awkward. It should be "to justify."
3. **Syntax error**: "Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else." - The phrase "conducts violent action" is awkward. It should be "commits the violent action."
4. **Syntax error**: "Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack?" - The phrase "in case that" should be "if."
5. **Unidiomatic error**: "the subject of war cannot be specified." - The phrase "the subject of war" is unclear. It should be "the parties involved in a war."

Start your answer with a line containing only the number of mistakes between two @ symbols. Here is the paragraph: War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified.

Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies.

Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries.

1. **Syntax error**: "For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A." - The comma placement is awkward and disrupts the flow of the sentence.
2. **Agreement error**: "B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong." - The subject "action" is singular, so "may" should be "may be."
3. **Syntax error**: "Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else." - The phrase "conducts violent action" is awkward and can be simplified.
4. **Unidiomatic error**: "A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation." - The phrase "A’s unpleasant circumstance" is awkward and can be made more natural.
5. **Syntax error**: "Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack?" - The phrase "in case that" is awkward and should be "in the case that."

For instance, one person, say, A, punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite and may be morally wrong.

Violent action can be justified only if the person who commits the violent action was already under attack from someone else.

Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries.

2. **Agreement error**: "B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong." - The subject "action" is singular, so "may" should be "may be."
3. **Syntax error**: "Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else." - The phrase "conducts violent action" is awkward and can be simplified.
4. **Unidiomatic error**: "A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation." - The phrase "A’s unpleasant circumstance" is awkward and can be made more natural.
5. **Syntax error**: "Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack?" - The phrase "in case that" is awkward and should be "in the case that."

Revised paragraph:
War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A, punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite and may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still, A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who commits the violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve the unpleasant situation with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in the case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified.

Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies.

Revised paragraph:
Several epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene variants are highly associated with many cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, which is the second-most common lung cancer type worldwide [ref]. Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision on cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation: the RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, have become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like form. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study suggests using nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022).

Revised paragraph:
Several epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene variants are highly associated with many cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, which is the second-most common lung cancer type worldwide [ref]. Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision on cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation: they consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from the entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, have become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study suggests nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right.

The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

When COVID-19 first emerged, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even had their privacy intruded upon for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media explained how different COVID-19 symptoms are from the flu. However, now, the response to COVID-19 is facing a new situation. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that the two diseases are extremely manageable except for those who are not reasonably healthy, simply by maintaining good eating and sleeping habits (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to become less aggressive in regulating COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

Start your answer with a line containing only the number of mistakes between two @ symbols. Here is the paragraph: Several epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene variants are highly associated with many cancers [ref] including non-small cell lung cancer, which is the second-most common lung cancer type worldwide [ref]. Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

Start your answer with a line containing only the number of mistakes between two @ symbols. Here is the paragraph: War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified.

1. **Syntax error**: "For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A." - The phrase "say, A punches" should be "say, A, punches" to correctly set off the name with commas.
2. **Syntax error**: "Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action." - The phrase "for justifying" is awkward. It should be "to justify."
3. **Syntax error**: "Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else." - The phrase "conducts violent action" is awkward. It should be "commits a violent action."
4. **Syntax error**: "Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack?" - The phrase "in case that" should be "if."
5. **Unidiomatic error**: "Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified." - The phrase "the subject of war cannot be specified" is unclear. It should be "the parties involved in a war cannot be as clearly defined."

Revised paragraph:
War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A, punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient to justify A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who commits a violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only if the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the parties involved in a war cannot be as clearly defined.

You are trying to help English language learners improve the grammatical accuracy of their writing. A grammar error is any issue within a sentence that makes it difficult to understand. Punctuation errors are related to the incorrect use of punctuation marks (e.g., periods, commas, semicolons, quotation marks) in sentences. Syntax errors involve issues with sentence structure or word order. Preposition errors involve the incorrect use of prepositions, which are words that show the relationship between nouns or pronouns and other elements in a sentence (e.g., “in,” “on,” “at,” “by”). Tense/aspect errors are related to the incorrect use of verb tenses (past, present, future) or aspects (e.g., progressive, perfect), which indicate the time and duration of an action. Spelling errors involve the incorrect spelling of words. Unidiomatic errors occur where phrases or expressions were not used in a natural or standard way according to the conventions of the language. Agreement errors involve the lack of agreement between subject and verb (subject-verb agreement) or between nouns and pronouns (pronoun-antecedent agreement). Determiner errors are related to the incorrect use of determiners (e.g., “a,” “an,” “the,” “some,” “this”) that introduce nouns. Morphology errors involve the incorrect formation or inflection of words, including issues with prefixes, suffixes, or word roots. Miscellaneous errors are those that do not fit neatly into other categories, often including a variety of uncommon or unique issues. Multiple errors are instances where more than one type of error occurs in the same sentence or phrase, making it difficult to categorize under a single error type.'}]}

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

   - "all people" is unidiomatic. "Everyone" is more natural.
   - "itself" is unnecessary and awkward here.

2. "The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread."
   - "The first time COVID-19 occurred" is unidiomatic. "When COVID-19 first emerged" is more natural.

3. "The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest."
   - "got intruded on their privacy" is unidiomatic. "had their privacy intruded upon" is more natural.

4. "Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are."
   - "introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are" is unidiomatic and awkward. "explained how COVID-19 symptoms differ from the flu" is more natural.

You are trying to help English language learners improve the grammatical accuracy of their writing. A grammar error is any issue within a sentence that makes it difficult to understand. Punctuation errors are related to the incorrect use of punctuation marks (e.g., periods, commas, semicolons, quotation marks) in sentences. Syntax errors involve issues with sentence structure or word order. Preposition errors involve the incorrect use of prepositions, which are words that show the relationship between nouns or pronouns and other elements in a sentence (e.g., “in,” “on,” “at,” “by”). Tense/aspect errors are related to the incorrect use of verb tenses (past, present, future) or aspects (e.g., progressive, perfect), which indicate the time and duration of an action. Spelling errors involve the incorrect spelling of words. Unidiomatic errors occur where phrases or expressions were not used in a natural or standard way according to the conventions of the language. Agreement errors involve the lack of agreement between subject and verb (subject-verb agreement) or between nouns and pronouns (pronoun-antecedent agreement). Determiner errors are related to the incorrect use of determiners (e.g., “a,” “an,” “the,” “some,” “this”) that introduce nouns. Morphology errors involve the incorrect formation or inflection of words, including issues with prefixes, suffixes, or word roots.

2024-09-09 08:49:26,040 - gptcli-session - INFO - user: Can you check the following paragraph, located after the colon, for grammar errors, count the number of errors, place the number of grammar errors between @ symbols even if the number is zero (e.g, @0@, @1@, @2@, @3@, etc), explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph. Start your answer with a line containing only the number of mistakes between two @ symbols. Here is the paragraph: Several epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene variants are highly associated with many cancers [ref] including non-small cell lung cancer, which is the second-most common lung cancer type worldwide [ref]. Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

Revised paragraph:
War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly, it may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts the violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only if the country that starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the parties involved in a war cannot be specified.

The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

Revised paragraph:
Several epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene variants are highly associated with many cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, which is the second-most common lung cancer type worldwide. Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision-making for cancer treatment, and improvement in the prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation: they consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, have become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study suggests using nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to better reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

Revised Paragraph:
For the last two years and several months, everyone has been suffering from COVID-19 itself and the related effects of the disease. When COVID-19 first emerged, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even had their privacy intruded upon for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms are from the flu. However, now, the response to COVID-19 has encountered a new situation. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that the two diseases are extremely manageable for reasonably healthy people, simply by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to become less aggressive in regulating COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage COVID-19 variants and future pandemics.

You are trying to help English language learners improve the grammatical accuracy of their writing. A grammar error is any issue within a sentence that makes it difficult to understand. Punctuation errors are related to the incorrect use of punctuation marks (e.g., periods, commas, semicolons, quotation marks) in sentences. Syntax errors involve issues with sentence structure or word order. Preposition errors involve the incorrect use of prepositions, which are words that show the relationship between nouns or pronouns and other elements in a sentence (e.g., “in,” “on,” “at,” “by”). Tense/aspect errors are related to the incorrect use of verb tenses (past, present, future) or aspects (e.g., progressive, perfect), which indicate the time and duration of an action. Spelling errors involve the incorrect spelling of words. Unidiomatic errors occur where phrases or expressions were not used in a natural or standard way according to the conventions of the language. Agreement errors involve the lack of agreement between subject and verb (subject-verb agreement) or between nouns and pronouns (pronoun-antecedent agreement). Determiner errors are related to the incorrect use of determiners (e.g., “a,” “an,” “the,” “some,” “this”) that introduce nouns. Morphology errors involve the incorrect formation or inflection of words, including issues with prefixes, suffixes, or word roots. Miscellaneous errors are those that do not fit neatly into other categories, often including a variety of uncommon or unique issues. Multiple errors are instances where more than one type of error occurs in the same sentence or phrase, making it difficult to categorize under a single error type.'}]}

Start your answer with a line containing only the number of mistakes between two @ symbols. Here is the paragraph: Several epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene variants are highly associated with many cancers [ref] including non-small cell lung cancer, which is the second-most common lung cancer type worldwide [ref]. Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

Start your answer with a line containing only the number of mistakes between two @ symbols. Here is the paragraph: War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified.

Revised Paragraph:
For the last two years and several months, everyone has been suffering from COVID-19 itself and the related effects of the disease. When COVID-19 first emerged, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even had their privacy intruded upon for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms are from the flu. However, now, the response to COVID-19 has encountered a new situation. Although the two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that the two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, simply by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to adopt less aggressive regulations for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

Revised paragraph:
War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly, it may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts the violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only if the country that starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war is not as clear-cut.

However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022).

Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies.

Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

1. **Punctuation error**: The first sentence lacks a comma before the phrase "including non-small cell lung cancer."
2. **Punctuation error**: The phrase "decision of cancer treatment" is awkward and unidiomatic; it should be "decision-making for cancer treatment."
3. **Syntax error**: The phrase "one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA" is awkward and unclear. It should be rephrased for clarity.
4. **Tense/aspect error**: The phrase "become widely used" should be "have become widely used" to match the present perfect tense.
5. **Agreement error**: The phrase "EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms" should be rephrased for clarity and agreement.
6. **Miscellaneous error**: The phrase "this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results" is awkward and could be clearer.

Upon careful review, the initial assessment remains accurate. Here is a detailed breakdown of the errors:

1. **Punctuation error**: The first sentence lacks a comma before the phrase "including non-small cell lung cancer."
2. **Punctuation error**: The phrase "decision of cancer treatment" is awkward and unidiomatic; it should be "decision-making for cancer treatment."
3. **Syntax error**: The phrase "one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA" is awkward and unclear. It should be rephrased for clarity.
4. **Tense/aspect error**: The phrase "become widely used" should be "have become widely used" to match the present perfect tense.
5. **Agreement error**: The phrase "EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms" should be rephrased for clarity and agreement.
6. **Miscellaneous error**: The phrase "this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results" is awkward and could be clearer.

Revised paragraph:
Several epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene variants are highly associated with many cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, which is the second-most common lung cancer type worldwide [ref]. Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision-making for cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation: they consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, have become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study suggests using nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to better reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

자세히 검토한 결과, 초기 평가가 정확함을 확인했습니다. 다음은 오류에 대한 자세한 설명입니다:

1. **구두점 오류**: 첫 번째 문장은 "including non-small cell lung cancer" 구절 앞에 쉼표가 필요합니다.
2. **구두점 오류**: "decision of cancer treatment"라는 구절은 어색하고 비관용적입니다. "decision-making for cancer treatment"로 수정해야 합니다.
3. **구문 오류**: "one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA"라는 구절은 어색하고 명확하지 않습니다. 명확하게 다시 표현해야 합니다.
4. **시제/상 오류**: "become widely used"라는 구절은 현재완료 시제에 맞추기 위해 "have become widely used"로 수정해야 합니다.
5. **일치 오류**: "EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms"라는 구절은 명확성과 일치를 위해 다시 표현해야 합니다.
6. **기타 오류**: "this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results"라는 구절은 어색하며 더 명확하게 표현할 수 있습니다.

Assistant config: {'model': 'gpt-4o', 'temperature': 0, 'messages': [{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a English language educator. You are trying to help English language learners improve the grammatical accuracy of their writing. A grammar error is any issue within a sentence that makes it difficult to understand. Punctuation errors are related to the incorrect use of punctuation marks (e.g., periods, commas, semicolons, quotation marks) in sentences. Syntax errors involve issues with sentence structure or word order. Preposition errors involve the incorrect use of prepositions, which are words that show the relationship between nouns or pronouns and other elements in a sentence (e.g., “in,” “on,” “at,” “by”). Tense/aspect errors are related to the incorrect use of verb tenses (past, present, future) or aspects (e.g., progressive, perfect), which indicate the time and duration of an action. Spelling errors involve the incorrect spelling of words. Unidiomatic errors occur where phrases or expressions were not used in a natural or standard way according to the conventions of the language. Agreement errors involve the lack of agreement between subject and verb (subject-verb agreement) or between nouns and pronouns (pronoun-antecedent agreement). Determiner errors are related to the incorrect use of determiners (e.g., “a,” “an,” “the,” “some,” “this”) that introduce nouns. Morphology errors involve the incorrect formation or inflection of words, including issues with prefixes, suffixes, or word roots. Miscellaneous errors are those that do not fit neatly into other categories, often including a variety of uncommon or unique issues. Multiple errors are instances where more than one type of error occurs in the same sentence or phrase, making it difficult to categorize under a single error type.'}]}

Start your answer with a line containing only the number of mistakes between two @ symbols. Here is the paragraph: War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified.
