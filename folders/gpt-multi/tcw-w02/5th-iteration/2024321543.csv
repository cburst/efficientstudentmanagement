"2024321543","1. Remove the comma after ""CGMs"" in the sentence: ""Patients have reported adverse effects while using the current CGMs, (e.g., skin irritations caused by strong adhesives, or additional patches including allergens which prevent the rigid device from falling off the curved body surfaces [2].""  
2. Add a comma after ""allergens"" in the same sentence: ""Patients have reported adverse effects while using the current CGMs (e.g., skin irritations caused by strong adhesives, or additional patches including allergens, which prevent the rigid device from falling off the curved body surfaces [2].""  
3. Consider rephrasing ""despite efforts made"" to ""despite the efforts made"" for clarity: ""commercialization of these platforms has not been successful despite the efforts made [3].""","<total_errors:3><preposition_errors:0><morphology_errors:0><determiner_errors:0><tense-aspect_errors:0><agreement_errors:0><syntax_errors:0><punctuation_errors:2><spelling_errors:0><unidiomatic_errors:1><multiple_errors:0><miscellaneous_errors:0>","<certainty:95>","<total_errors:3><preposition_errors:0><morphology_errors:0><determiner_errors:0><tense-aspect_errors:0><agreement_errors:0><syntax_errors:0><punctuation_errors:2><spelling_errors:0><unidiomatic_errors:1><multiple_errors:0><miscellaneous_errors:0>","1. **Punctuation Error**: In the sentence ""Patients have reported adverse effects while using the current CGMs, (e.g., skin irritations caused by strong adhesives, or additional patches including allergens which prevent the rigid device from falling off the curved body surfaces [2]."", there is an unnecessary comma after ""CGMs."" The comma should be removed to correctly introduce the parenthetical example.

2. **Punctuation Error**: In the same sentence, a comma is needed after ""allergens"" to correctly separate the non-restrictive clause: ""or additional patches including allergens, which prevent the rigid device from falling off the curved body surfaces [2].""

3. **Unidiomatic Error**: The phrase ""despite efforts made"" is slightly awkward and can be improved for clarity. It would be more idiomatic to say ""despite the efforts made"" to ensure the sentence flows more naturally: ""commercialization of these platforms has not been successful despite the efforts made [3].""","My research goal is to develop a flexible wearable glucose sensor platform to overcome the limitations of the current continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems. CGMs have revolutionized the diabetic management market by indicating glucose level trends in a less invasive manner compared to the traditional finger stick method; however, they still have limitations, mainly in relation to sensor rigidity [1]. Patients have reported adverse effects while using the current CGMs (e.g., skin irritations caused by strong adhesives, or additional patches including allergens, which prevent the rigid device from falling off the curved body surfaces [2]. In addition, the CGMs in the market still require needle insertion to place the filament sensor into the body, which causes pain during application. Projects have been conducted to develop flexible CGMs with different biofluids (e.g., sweat, tear, and interstitial fluid); however, commercialization of these platforms has not been successful despite the efforts made [3]. By developing CGM platforms that include conformal contact with the skin by utilizing flexible and biocompatible materials, I believe future CGMs can significantly improve the quality of life for many diabetic patients."
