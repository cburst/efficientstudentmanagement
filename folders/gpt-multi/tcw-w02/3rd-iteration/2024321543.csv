"2024321543","The text is mostly well-written, but there are a few areas that could be improved for grammatical accuracy and clarity:

1. **Punctuation Error**: The sentence ""Patients have reported adverse effects while using the current CGMs, (e.g., skin irritations caused by strong adhesives, or additional patches including allergens which prevent the rigid device from falling off the curved body surfaces [2]."" has an unnecessary comma after ""CGMs"" and a misplaced parenthesis. It should be: ""Patients have reported adverse effects while using the current CGMs (e.g., skin irritations caused by strong adhesives or additional patches including allergens, which prevent the rigid device from falling off the curved body surfaces) [2].""

2. **Agreement Error**: In the sentence ""Projects have been conducted to develop flexible CGMs with different biofluids (e.g., sweat, tear, and interstitial fluid); however, commercialization of these platforms has not been successful despite efforts made [3]."" the word ""tear"" should be plural to match ""sweat"" and ""interstitial fluid."" It should be: ""Projects have been conducted to develop flexible CGMs with different biofluids (e.g., sweat, tears, and interstitial fluid); however, commercialization of these platforms has not been successful despite efforts made [3].""

3. **Punctuation Error**: The semicolon in ""Projects have been conducted to develop flexible CGMs with different biofluids (e.g., sweat, tear, and interstitial fluid); however, commercialization of these platforms has not been successful despite efforts made [3]."" should be followed by a comma for better readability. It should be: ""Projects have been conducted to develop flexible CGMs with different biofluids (e.g., sweat, tears, and interstitial fluid); however, commercialization of these platforms has not been successful, despite efforts made [3].""

4. **Unidiomatic Error**: The phrase ""despite efforts made"" is slightly awkward. A more idiomatic expression would be ""despite the efforts made"" or ""despite efforts being made.""

""My research goal is to develop a flexible wearable glucose sensor platform to overcome the limitations of the current continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems. CGMs have revolutionized the diabetic management market by indicating glucose level trends in a less invasive manner compared to the traditional finger stick method; however, they still have limitations, mainly in relation to sensor rigidity [1]. Patients have reported adverse effects while using the current CGMs (e.g., skin irritations caused by strong adhesives or additional patches including allergens, which prevent the rigid device from falling off the curved body surfaces) [2]. In addition, the CGMs in the market still require needle insertion to place the filament sensor into the body, which causes pain during application. Projects have been conducted to develop flexible CGMs with different biofluids (e.g., sweat, tears, and interstitial fluid); however, commercialization of these platforms has not been successful, despite the efforts made [3].
