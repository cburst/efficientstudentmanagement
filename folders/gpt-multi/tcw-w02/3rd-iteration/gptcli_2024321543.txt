You are trying to help English language learners improve the grammatical accuracy of their writing. A grammar error is any issue within a sentence that makes it difficult to understand. Punctuation errors are related to the incorrect use of punctuation marks (e.g., periods, commas, semicolons, quotation marks) in sentences. Syntax errors involve issues with sentence structure or word order. Preposition errors involve the incorrect use of prepositions, which are words that show the relationship between nouns or pronouns and other elements in a sentence (e.g., “in,” “on,” “at,” “by”). Tense/aspect errors are related to the incorrect use of verb tenses (past, present, future) or aspects (e.g., progressive, perfect), which indicate the time and duration of an action. Spelling errors involve the incorrect spelling of words. Unidiomatic errors occur where phrases or expressions were not used in a natural or standard way according to the conventions of the language. Agreement errors involve the lack of agreement between subject and verb (subject-verb agreement) or between nouns and pronouns (pronoun-antecedent agreement). Determiner errors are related to the incorrect use of determiners (e.g., “a,” “an,” “the,” “some,” “this”) that introduce nouns. Morphology errors involve the incorrect formation or inflection of words, including issues with prefixes, suffixes, or word roots. Miscellaneous errors are those that do not fit neatly into other categories, often including a variety of uncommon or unique issues. Multiple errors are instances where more than one type of error occurs in the same sentence or phrase, making it difficult to categorize under a single error type.'}]}

Please check for any grammar errors in the following text: My research goal is to develop a flexible wearable glucose sensor platform to overcome the limitations of the current continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems. CGMs have revolutionized the diabetic management market by indicating glucose level trends in a less invasive manner compared to the traditional finger stick method; however, they still have limitations, mainly in relation to sensor rigidity [1]. Patients have reported adverse effects while using the current CGMs, (e.g., skin irritations caused by strong adhesives, or additional patches including allergens which prevent the rigid device from falling off the curved body surfaces [2]. In addition, the CGMs in the market still require needle insertion to place the filament sensor into the body, which causes pain during application. Projects have been conducted to develop flexible CGMs with different biofluids (e.g., sweat, tear, and interstitial fluid); however, commercialization of these platforms has not been successful despite efforts made [3]. By developing CGM platforms that include conformal contact with the skin by utilizing flexible and biocompatible materials, I believe future CGMs can significantly improve the quality of life for many diabetic patients.

The text is mostly well-written, but there are a few areas that could be improved for grammatical accuracy and clarity:

1. **Punctuation Error**: The sentence "Patients have reported adverse effects while using the current CGMs, (e.g., skin irritations caused by strong adhesives, or additional patches including allergens which prevent the rigid device from falling off the curved body surfaces [2]." has an unnecessary comma after "CGMs" and a misplaced parenthesis. It should be: "Patients have reported adverse effects while using the current CGMs (e.g., skin irritations caused by strong adhesives or additional patches including allergens, which prevent the rigid device from falling off the curved body surfaces) [2]."

2. **Agreement Error**: In the sentence "Projects have been conducted to develop flexible CGMs with different biofluids (e.g., sweat, tear, and interstitial fluid); however, commercialization of these platforms has not been successful despite efforts made [3]." the word "tear" should be plural to match "sweat" and "interstitial fluid." It should be: "Projects have been conducted to develop flexible CGMs with different biofluids (e.g., sweat, tears, and interstitial fluid); however, commercialization of these platforms has not been successful despite efforts made [3]."

3. **Punctuation Error**: The semicolon in "Projects have been conducted to develop flexible CGMs with different biofluids (e.g., sweat, tear, and interstitial fluid); however, commercialization of these platforms has not been successful despite efforts made [3]." should be followed by a comma for better readability. It should be: "Projects have been conducted to develop flexible CGMs with different biofluids (e.g., sweat, tears, and interstitial fluid); however, commercialization of these platforms has not been successful, despite efforts made [3]."

4. **Unidiomatic Error**: The phrase "despite efforts made" is slightly awkward. A more idiomatic expression would be "despite the efforts made" or "despite efforts being made."

5. **Punctuation Error**: The sentence "By developing CGM platforms that include conformal contact with the skin by utilizing flexible and biocompatible materials, I believe future CGMs can significantly improve the quality of life for many diabetic patients." could benefit from a comma after "materials" for better readability. However, this is more of a stylistic choice and not strictly necessary.
