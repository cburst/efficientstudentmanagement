"2024321543","1. In the sentence ""Patients have reported adverse effects while using the current CGMs, (e.g., skin irritations caused by strong adhesives, or additional patches including allergens which prevent the rigid device from falling off the curved body surfaces [2],"" remove the comma after ""CGMs"" and before the parenthesis.  
2. Add a comma after ""allergens"" in the same sentence to separate the non-essential clause: ""e.g., skin irritations caused by strong adhesives or additional patches, including allergens, which prevent the rigid device from falling off the curved body surfaces [2].""  
3. In the sentence ""Projects have been conducted to develop flexible CGMs with different biofluids (e.g., sweat, tear, and interstitial fluid); however, commercialization of these platforms has not been successful despite efforts made [3],"" change ""tear"" to ""tears"" for consistency in plural form.

The correct form is ""Patients have reported adverse effects while using the current CGMs (e.g., skin irritations caused by strong adhesives or additional patches including allergens which prevent the rigid device from falling off the curved body surfaces [2]).""

2. **Punctuation Error**: In the same sentence, a comma should be added after ""allergens"" to properly separate the non-essential clause: ""e.g., skin irritations caused by strong adhesives or additional patches, including allergens, which prevent the rigid device from falling off the curved body surfaces [2].""

3. **Punctuation Error**: In the sentence ""Projects have been conducted to develop flexible CGMs with different biofluids (e.g., sweat, tear, and interstitial fluid); however, commercialization of these platforms has not been successful despite efforts made [3],"" the word ""tear"" should be pluralized to ""tears"" for consistency with the list of biofluids: ""e.g., sweat, tears, and interstitial fluid.""

4. **Punctuation Error**: In the same sentence, a comma should be added after ""successful"" to separate the clauses: ""commercialization of these platforms has not been successful, despite efforts made [3].""","My research goal is to develop a flexible wearable glucose sensor platform to overcome the limitations of the current continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems. CGMs have revolutionized the diabetic management market by indicating glucose level trends in a less invasive manner compared to the traditional finger stick method; however, they still have limitations, mainly in relation to sensor rigidity [1]. Patients have reported adverse effects while using the current CGMs (e.g., skin irritations caused by strong adhesives or additional patches, including allergens, which prevent the rigid device from falling off the curved body surfaces [2]). In addition, the CGMs in the market still require needle insertion to place the filament sensor into the body, which causes pain during application. Projects have been conducted to develop flexible CGMs with different biofluids (e.g., sweat, tears, and interstitial fluid); however, commercialization of these platforms has not been successful, despite efforts made [3]. By developing CGM platforms that include conformal contact with the skin by utilizing flexible and biocompatible materials, I believe future CGMs can significantly improve the quality of life for many diabetic patients."
