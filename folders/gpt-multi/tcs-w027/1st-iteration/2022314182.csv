"2022314182","The text is generally well-written, but there are a few areas where clarity and grammatical accuracy can be improved:

1. **Punctuation Error**: In the sentence ""In [3], where pruning was applied to the Stable Diffusion model, latency was measured not based on neurons or layers in a neural network, but on transformer-based blocks, and unnecessary components were removed accordingly,"" the comma before ""and unnecessary components were removed accordingly"" is unnecessary. It should be removed for better flow.

2. **Syntax Error**: The phrase ""As shown on the right, the motion module is composed of multiple layers within each block"" could be clearer. Consider rephrasing to ""As shown in the image on the right, the motion module is composed of multiple layers within each block.""

3. **Unidiomatic Expression**: The phrase ""The results of cosine similarity between input and output are shown in image (B)"" could be more idiomatic. Consider rephrasing to ""The cosine similarity results between input and output are shown in image (B).""

4. **Punctuation Error**: In the sentence ""Specifically, (1) Transformer Temporal Model has similarity values ranging from 0.6 to 0.93, whereas (2) Basic Transformer Block has similarity values ranging from 0.15 to 0.53, and (3) has values ranging from 0.02 to 0.51, which are relatively low,"" the list format is inconsistent. Consider rephrasing to ""Specifically, (1) the Transformer Temporal Model has similarity values ranging from 0.6 to 0.93, (2) the Basic Transformer Block has similarity values ranging from 0.15 to 0.53, and (3) another component has values ranging from 0.02 to 0.51, which are relatively low.""

5. **Syntax Error**: The sentence ""In practice, when several blocks of (1) were removed, the performance in video generation was superior compared to removing fewer blocks of the small motion attention in (3)"" could be clearer. Consider rephrasing to ""In practice, removing several blocks of (1) resulted in superior video generation performance compared to removing fewer blocks of the small motion attention in (3).""

6. **Punctuation Error**: In the sentence ""As can be seen in image C, the quality of the generated video is significantly degraded when only one attention block is removed,"" the comma after ""As can be seen in image C"" is correct, but ensure consistency in referring to images (e.g., ""image C"" vs. ""image (B)"").

7. **Syntax Error**: The sentence ""The performance at that time was checked to determine the level up to which layers should be deleted"" could be clearer. Consider rephrasing to ""The performance was evaluated at each stage to determine the extent to which layers should be deleted.""

These explanations provide a detailed account of the errors identified in the text.","To create a lighter model, we aim to identify and eliminate the parts of the motion module that contribute the most to latency. In [3], where pruning was applied to the Stable Diffusion model, latency was measured not based on neurons or layers in a neural network but on transformer-based blocks, and unnecessary components were removed accordingly. To prune the motion module, we employed two approaches. First, we examined the structure of the motion module to identify units for pruning. As shown in the image on the right, the motion module is composed of multiple layers within each block. To determine which units to prune, we measured the cosine similarity between the input and output based on transformer blocks and transformer layers. The underlying assumption here is that unnecessary components will have a high cosine similarity between their input and output. The cosine similarity results between input and output are shown in image (B). Specifically, (1) the Transformer Temporal Model has similarity values ranging from 0.6 to 0.93, (2) the Basic Transformer Block has similarity values ranging from 0.15 to 0.53, and (3) another component has values ranging from 0.02 to 0.51, which are relatively low. This suggests that the Transformer Block may have considerable redundancy. In practice, removing several blocks of (1) resulted in superior video generation performance compared to removing fewer blocks of the small motion attention in (3). As can be seen in image C, the quality of the generated video is significantly degraded when only one attention block is removed. To determine how many attention blocks to remove, we decided to delete blocks one by one from the original motion module and evaluate the performance. Since the motion module has a total of 21 blocks, this results in 21 variations of the module after deletion. By measuring the FVD (Frechet Video Distance) of the videos generated by the original motion module and those generated after deleting each block, we aim to assess how the video changes with block removal. The assumption is that the more the video changes, i.e., the higher the FVD, the more important the removed block is considered to be. Layers were deleted according to a sequence, and distillation was performed using the data. The performance was evaluated at each stage to determine the extent to which layers should be deleted."
