"2022314182","The text you provided is mostly clear and well-structured, but there are a few areas where minor improvements can be made for clarity and grammatical accuracy:

1. **Punctuation Error**: In the sentence ""The results of cosine similarity between input and output are shown in image (B),"" the word ""image"" should not be capitalized unless it is part of a title or heading. Consider using lowercase: ""image (B).""

2. **Syntax Error**: In the sentence ""As can be seen in image C, the quality of the generated video is significantly degraded when only one attention block is removed,"" it might be clearer to specify what ""image C"" refers to. If ""image C"" is a figure or diagram, consider rephrasing to ""As shown in Figure C, the quality...""

3. **Unidiomatic Expression**: The phrase ""the level up to which layers should be deleted"" could be more idiomatically expressed as ""the extent to which layers should be deleted.""

4. **Miscellaneous Error**: The sentence ""The assumption is that the more the video changes, i.e., the higher the FVD, the more important the removed block is considered to be"" could be made clearer by rephrasing it to ""The assumption is that the greater the change in the video, indicated by a higher FVD, the more important the removed block is considered to be.""

Here is the revised text with these suggestions incorporated:

To create a lighter model, we aim to identify and eliminate the parts of the motion module that contribute the most to latency. In [3], where pruning was applied to the Stable Diffusion model, latency was measured not based on neurons or layers in a neural network, but on transformer-based blocks, and unnecessary components were removed accordingly. To prune the motion module, we employed two approaches. First, we examined the structure of the motion module to identify units for pruning. As shown on the right, the motion module is composed of multiple layers within each block. To determine which units to prune, we measured the cosine similarity between the input and output based on transformer blocks and transformer layers. The underlying assumption here is that unnecessary components will have a high cosine similarity between their input and output. The results of cosine similarity between input and output are shown in image (B). Specifically, (1) Transformer Temporal Model has similarity values ranging from 0.6 to 0.93, whereas (2) Basic Transformer Block has similarity values ranging from 0.15 to 0.53, and (3) has values ranging from 0.02 to 0.51, which are relatively low. This suggests that the Transformer Block may have considerable redundancy. In practice, when several blocks of (1) were removed, the performance in video generation was superior compared to removing fewer blocks of the small motion attention in (3). As shown in Figure C, the quality of the generated video is significantly degraded when only one attention block is removed. To determine how many attention blocks to remove, we decided to delete blocks one by one from the original motion module and evaluate the performance. Since the motion module has a total of 21 blocks, this results in 21 variations of the module after deletion. By measuring the FVD (Frechet Video Distance) of the videos generated by the original motion module and those generated after deleting each block, we aim to assess how the video changes with block removal. The assumption is that the greater the change in the video, indicated by a higher FVD, the more important the removed block is considered to be. Layers were deleted according to a sequence, and distillation was performed using the data. The performance at that time was checked to determine the extent to which layers should be deleted.","<total_errors:5><preposition_errors:0><morphology_errors:0><determiner_errors:0><tense-aspect_errors:0><agreement_errors:0><syntax_errors:1><punctuation_errors:1><spelling_errors:0><unidiomatic_errors:2><multiple_errors:0><miscellaneous_errors:1>","<certainty:95>","<total_errors:4><preposition_errors:0><morphology_errors:0><determiner_errors:0><tense-aspect_errors:0><agreement_errors:0><syntax_errors:1><punctuation_errors:1><spelling_errors:0><unidiomatic_errors:1><multiple_errors:0><miscellaneous_errors:1>","Here is a detailed explanation of each identified error:

1. **Syntax Error**: 
   - Original: ""As can be seen in image C, the quality of the generated video is significantly degraded when only one attention block is removed.""
   - Explanation: The phrase ""As can be seen in image C"" could be clearer if ""image C"" is specified as a figure or diagram. A more precise phrasing would be ""As shown in Figure C,"" which helps the reader understand the reference more clearly.

2. **Punctuation Error**:
   - Original: ""The results of cosine similarity between input and output are shown in image (B).""
   - Explanation: The word ""image"" should not be capitalized unless it is part of a title or heading. It should be ""image (B)"" unless ""Image"" is a proper noun or title in this context.

3. **Unidiomatic Error**:
   - Original: ""the level up to which layers should be deleted.""
   - Explanation: This phrase is not idiomatic in English. A more natural expression would be ""the extent to which layers should be deleted.""

4. **Miscellaneous Error**:
   - Original: ""The assumption is that the more the video changes, i.e., the higher the FVD, the more important the removed block is considered to be.""
   - Explanation: The sentence could be made clearer by rephrasing it to ""The assumption is that the greater the change in the video, indicated by a higher FVD, the more important the removed block is considered to be."" This rephrasing improves clarity and flow.

These explanations correspond to the errors identified in the text, ensuring that the total error count and types are accurate.","To create a lighter model, we aim to identify and eliminate the parts of the motion module that contribute the most to latency.
