Upon double-checking, I found an additional error:

1. Preposition errors: !1! - "related with" should be "related to."

2. Morphology errors: #1# - "circuit's" should be "circuits'."

3. Determiner errors: €2€ - "the different research area" should be "a different research area," and "signal-processing area" should be "the signal-processing area."

4. Tense/Aspect errors: %3% - "is measured" should be "was measured," "has deeply related" should be "is deeply related," and "mentioned" should be "mention."

5. Agreement errors: ^1^ - "needs to more further discussion" should be "more discussion is needed," which also involves subject-verb agreement.

6. Syntax errors: &3& - "Especially for the system analysis article, commonly explains mechanism and principle about it in signal-processing prospect" needs rephrasing, "what is the efficient method" should be "what the efficient method is," and "needs to more further discussion" should be "more discussion is needed."

7. Punctuation errors: £2£ - A comma is needed after "area," and "signal processing" should be hyphenated as "signal-processing."

8. Spelling errors: ~0~

9. Unidiomatic errors: +3+ - "Studying about" should be "studying," the sentence "Especially for the system analysis article, commonly explains mechanism and principle about it in signal-processing prospect" is unidiomatic, and "needs to more further discussion" is unidiomatic.

Revised paragraph:

A radio frequency (RF) circuit and system for analog cancellation of self-interference signals in a full-duplex radio system was recently proposed. Researchers included an explanation of the whole system mechanism and each implemented circuits' behavior. Furthermore, researchers focused on the microwave circuit design and the required performance of each circuit. Researchers demonstrated the performance of the proposed system in severe environments, and each circuit was measured with common equipment. However, researchers provided an incomplete explanation of how the system works from a signal-processing perspective. The signal-processing perspective is a different research area, but recently many research areas are combined. Especially in system analysis articles, the mechanism and principles are commonly explained from a signal-processing perspective. In this article, this system is deeply related to the signal-processing area. All the researchers in this area mention how to control the whole system and why it is a reasonable method to use in the full-duplex system. Still, many researchers are studying what the efficient method is to control complex hardware and how to implement this method under the commercial communication standard. Overall, the researchers explained the design method and experimental system operation sufficiently, but more discussion of hardware control from a signal-processing perspective is necessary.
