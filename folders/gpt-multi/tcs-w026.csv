To prune the motion module, we employed two approaches. First, we examined the structure of the motion module to identify units for pruning. As shown on the right, the motion module is composed of multiple layers within each block. To determine which units to prune, we measured the cosine similarity between the input and output based on transformer blocks and transformer layers.

The results of the cosine similarity between the input and output are shown in image (B). Specifically, (1) Transformer Temporal Model has similarity values ranging from 0.6 to 0.93, whereas (2) Basic Transformer Block has similarity values ranging from 0.15 to 0.53, and (3) has values ranging from 0.02 to 0.51, which are relatively low.

The assumption is that the more the video changes (i.e., the higher the FVD), the more important the removed block is considered to be.

   - **Correction**: ""This suggests that the Basic Transformer Block may have considerable redundancy.""
   - **Explanation**: The sentence refers to a specific type of transformer block, so specifying ""Basic Transformer Block"" is necessary for clarity.","To create a lighter model, we aim to identify and eliminate the parts of the motion module that contribute the most to latency. In [3], where pruning was applied to the Stable Diffusion model, latency was measured not based on neurons or layers in a neural network but on transformer-based blocks, and unnecessary components were removed accordingly. To prune the motion module, we employed two approaches. First, we examined the structure of the motion module to identify units for pruning. As shown on the right, the motion module is composed of multiple layers within each block. To determine which units to prune, we measured the cosine similarity between the input and output based on transformer blocks and transformer layers. The underlying assumption here is that unnecessary components will have a high cosine similarity between their input and output. The results of the cosine similarity between the input and output are shown in image (B). Specifically, (1) Transformer Temporal Model has similarity values ranging from 0.6 to 0.93, whereas (2) Basic Transformer Block has similarity values ranging from 0.15 to 0.53, and (3) has values ranging from 0.02 to 0.51, which are relatively low. This suggests that the Basic Transformer Block may have considerable redundancy. In practice, when several blocks of (1) were removed, the performance in video generation was superior compared to removing fewer blocks of the small motion attention in (3). As shown in image C, the quality of the generated video is significantly degraded when only one attention block is removed. To determine how many attention blocks to remove, we decided to delete blocks one by one from the original motion module and evaluate the performance. Since the motion module has a total of 21 blocks, this results in 21 variations of the module after deletion. By measuring the FVD (Frechet Video Distance) of the videos generated by the original motion module and those generated after deleting each block, we aim to assess how the video changes with block removal. The assumption is that the more the video changes (i.e., the higher the FVD), the more important the removed block is considered to be. Layers were deleted sequentially, and distillation was performed using the data. The performance was checked at each stage to determine how many layers should be deleted."
