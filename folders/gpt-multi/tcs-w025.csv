   - Explanation: The use of parentheses around the letter ""B"" is unnecessary in this context. It should be written as ""image B"" without parentheses, unless it is part of a specific notation or reference style.

3. **Unidiomatic Error**: 
   - Original: ""The level up to which layers should be deleted.""

Revised text with corrections:

To create a lighter model, we aim to identify and eliminate the parts of the motion module that contribute the most to latency. In [3], where pruning was applied to the Stable Diffusion model, latency was measured not based on neurons or layers in a neural network but on transformer-based blocks, and unnecessary components were removed accordingly. To prune the motion module, we employed two approaches. First, we examined the structure of the motion module to identify units for pruning. The motion module, as shown on the right, is composed of multiple layers within each block. To determine which units to prune, we measured the cosine similarity between the input and output based on transformer blocks and transformer layers. The underlying assumption here is that unnecessary components will have a high cosine similarity between their input and output. The cosine similarity results between input and output are shown in image (B). Specifically, (1) Transformer Temporal Models have similarity values ranging from 0.6 to 0.93, whereas (2) Basic Transformer Blocks have similarity values ranging from 0.15 to 0.53, and (3) has values ranging from 0.02 to 0.51, which are relatively low. This suggests that the Transformer Blocks may have considerable redundancy. In practice, when several blocks of (1) were removed, the performance in video generation was superior compared to removing fewer blocks of the small motion attention in (3). As can be seen in image C, the quality of the generated video is significantly degraded when only one attention block is removed. To determine how many attention blocks to remove, we decided to delete blocks one by one from the original motion module and evaluate the performance. Since the motion module has a total of 21 blocks, this results in 21 variations of the module after deletion. By measuring the FVD (Frechet Video Distance) of the videos generated by the original motion module and those generated after deleting each block, we aim to assess how the video changes with block removal. The assumption is that the greater the change in the video, indicated by a higher FVD, the more important the removed block is considered to be. Layers were deleted sequentially, and distillation was performed using the data. The performance was evaluated to determine the extent to which layers should be deleted.",<total_errors:10><preposition_errors:0><morphology_errors:0><determiner_errors:0><tense-aspect_errors:0><agreement_errors:1><syntax_errors:4><punctuation_errors:2><spelling_errors:0><unidiomatic_errors:3><multiple_errors:0><miscellaneous_errors:0>,<certainty:90>,<total_errors:10><preposition_errors:0><morphology_errors:0><determiner_errors:0><tense-aspect_errors:0><agreement_errors:1><syntax_errors:4><punctuation_errors:2><spelling_errors:0><unidiomatic_errors:3><multiple_errors:0><miscellaneous_errors:0>,"Here is a detailed explanation of each error identified in the text:
