"2022314182","Wearable biosensors have gained significant interest along with the introduction of commercial wearable smart devices such as the Apple Watch, which collect and analyze biological data such as sleeping patterns and heart rate. With the growing market exposure of wearable devices, demand and expectations for wearable biosensors to collect and analyze more sophisticated bio-data are increasing, especially in measuring continuous glucose levels, which are crucial for successful diabetic management. The global market for wearable glucose monitoring devices is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of around 12.89% [1]. I have chosen the field of wearable biosensors, especially in developing minimal or non-invasive device platforms, because I want to study and conduct research in a field where I can contribute to lessening the pain of patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes, who need to continuously monitor their disease every day. I believe that creating a wearable biosensor that detects alternative biofluids other than blood will help many patients with diabetes suffering from pain caused by traditional finger stick tests. However, detecting glucose in biofluids other than blood is challenging due to low sensitivity and accuracy issues [2]. Therefore, improving sensors by adopting novel designs, materials, and fabrication methods for different biofluids can be one of the areas where I could contribute to resolving the issues related to minimal or non-invasive wearable biosensors.","<total_errors:12><preposition_errors:1><morphology_errors:0><determiner_errors:1><tense-aspect_errors:1><agreement_errors:3><syntax_errors:0><punctuation_errors:3><spelling_errors:0><unidiomatic_errors:2><multiple_errors:0><miscellaneous_errors:1>","<certainty:95>","<total_errors:11><preposition_errors:0><morphology_errors:0><determiner_errors:1><tense-aspect_errors:0><agreement_errors:3><syntax_errors:0><punctuation_errors:3><spelling_errors:0><unidiomatic_errors:3><multiple_errors:0><miscellaneous_errors:1>","1. **Determiner Error**:  
   - ""Wearable biosensors gained significant interests"" should be ""Wearable biosensors have gained significant interest."" The determiner ""significant"" should be followed by the singular noun ""interest"" instead of the plural ""interests.""

2. **Agreement Errors**:  
   - ""which collects and analyzes biological data"" should be ""which collect and analyze biological data."" The subject ""devices"" is plural, so the verbs should also be in the plural form.
   - ""demand and expectations for wearable biosensors to collect and analyze more sophisticated bio-data is increasing"" should be ""are increasing."" The subject ""demand and expectations"" is plural, so the verb should be ""are.""
   - ""patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes, who needs to continuously monitor"" should be ""who need to continuously monitor."" The subject ""patients"" is plural, so the verb should be ""need.""

3. **Punctuation Errors**:  
   - ""device platforms because I want to study"" should have a comma after ""platforms"" to separate the clauses: ""device platforms, because I want to study.""
   - ""other than blood, will help many patients"" should not have a comma: ""other than blood will help many patients.""
   - ""Therefore, improving sensors by adopting novel designs, materials, and fabrication methods per different biofluids can be one of the areas that I could contribute to resolve the issues"" should have a comma after ""biofluids"": ""Therefore, improving sensors by adopting novel designs, materials, and fabrication methods, per different biofluids, can be one of the areas where I could contribute to resolving the issues.""

4. **Unidiomatic Errors**:  
   - ""gained significant interests"" should be ""gained significant interest."" The phrase ""significant interest"" is the idiomatic expression.
   - ""contribute in lessening pain of the patients"" should be ""contribute to lessening the pain of patients."" The correct idiomatic expression is ""contribute to.""
   - ""contribute to resolve the issues"" should be ""contribute to resolving the issues."" The correct idiomatic expression is ""contribute to"" followed by a gerund.

5. **Miscellaneous Error**:  
   - ""grow a compound annual growth rate"" should be ""grow at a compound annual growth rate."" The preposition ""at"" is needed to correctly express the rate of growth.","Wearable biosensors have gained significant interest along with the introduction of commercial wearable smart devices such as the Apple Watch, which collect and analyze biological data such as sleeping patterns and heart rate.
