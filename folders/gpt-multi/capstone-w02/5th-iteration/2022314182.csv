"2022314182","The text is generally well-written, but there are a few areas where clarity and grammatical accuracy can be improved:

1. **Punctuation Error**: In the sentence ""In [3], where pruning was applied to the Stable Diffusion model, latency was measured not based on neurons or layers in a neural network, but on transformer-based blocks, and unnecessary components were removed accordingly,"" the comma before ""and unnecessary components"" is unnecessary. It should be removed for better flow.

2. **Syntax Error**: The phrase ""As shown on the right, the motion module is composed of multiple layers within each block"" could be clearer. Consider rephrasing to ""As shown in the image on the right, the motion module consists of multiple layers within each block.""

3. **Unidiomatic Expression**: The phrase ""The results of cosine similarity between input and output are shown in image (B)"" could be more idiomatic. Consider rephrasing to ""The cosine similarity results between input and output are shown in image (B).""

4. **Agreement Error**: In the sentence ""This suggests that the Transformer Block may have considerable redundancy,"" the use of ""the Transformer Block"" suggests a singular entity, but the context implies multiple blocks. Consider rephrasing to ""This suggests that Transformer Blocks may have considerable redundancy.""

5. **Punctuation Error**: In the sentence ""As can be seen in image C, the quality of the generated video is significantly degraded when only one attention block is removed,"" the comma after ""image C"" is correct, but ensure consistency in referring to images (e.g., ""image (B)"" vs. ""image C"").

6. **Syntax Error**: The sentence ""The assumption is that the more the video changes, i.e., the higher the FVD, the more important the removed block is considered to be"" could be clearer. Consider rephrasing to ""The assumption is that the greater the change in the video, indicated by a higher FVD, the more important the removed block is considered to be.""

7. **Syntax Error**: The final sentence ""Layers were deleted according to a sequence, and distillation was performed using the data"" could be clearer. Consider rephrasing to ""Layers were deleted sequentially, and distillation was performed using the data.""

Revised text:
To create a lighter model, we aim to identify and eliminate the parts of the motion module that contribute the most to latency. In [3], where pruning was applied to the Stable Diffusion model, latency was measured not based on neurons or layers in a neural network but on transformer-based blocks, and unnecessary components were removed accordingly. To prune the motion module, we employed two approaches. First, we examined the structure of the motion module to identify units for pruning. As shown in the image on the right, the motion module consists of multiple layers within each block. To determine which units to prune, we measured the cosine similarity between the input and output based on transformer blocks and transformer layers. The underlying assumption here is that unnecessary components will have a high cosine similarity between their input and output. The cosine similarity results between input and output are shown in image (B). Specifically, (1) Transformer Temporal Model has similarity values ranging from 0.6 to 0.93, whereas (2) Basic Transformer Block has similarity values ranging from 0.15 to 0.53, and (3) has values ranging from 0.02 to 0.51, which are relatively low. This suggests that Transformer Blocks may have considerable redundancy. In practice, when several blocks of (1) were removed, the performance in video generation was superior compared to removing fewer blocks of the small motion attention in (3). As can be seen in image C, the quality of the generated video is significantly degraded when only one attention block is removed. To determine how many attention blocks to remove, we decided to delete blocks one by one from the original motion module and evaluate the performance. Since the motion module has a total of 21 blocks, this results in 21 variations of the module after deletion. By measuring the FVD (Frechet Video Distance) of the videos generated by the original motion module and those generated after deleting each block, we aim to assess how the video changes with block removal. The assumption is that the greater the change in the video, indicated by a higher FVD, the more important the removed block is considered to be. Layers were deleted sequentially, and distillation was performed using the data. The performance at that time was checked to determine the level up to which layers should be deleted.","<total_errors:10><preposition_errors:0><morphology_errors:0><determiner_errors:0><tense-aspect_errors:0><agreement_errors:1><syntax_errors:4><punctuation_errors:2><spelling_errors:0><unidiomatic_errors:2><multiple_errors:0><miscellaneous_errors:1>","<certainty:90>","<total_errors:9><preposition_errors:0><morphology_errors:0><determiner_errors:0><tense-aspect_errors:0><agreement_errors:1><syntax_errors:3><punctuation_errors:2><spelling_errors:0><unidiomatic_errors:2><multiple_errors:0><miscellaneous_errors:1>","Here is a detailed explanation of each identified error:
