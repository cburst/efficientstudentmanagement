"2022314182","The text you provided is mostly clear and well-structured, but there are a few areas where minor improvements can be made for clarity and grammatical accuracy:

1. **Punctuation Error**: In the sentence ""As shown on the right, the motion module is composed of multiple layers within each block,"" the phrase ""as shown on the right"" could be clarified with additional context or removed if it refers to a visual not included in the text.

2. **Syntax Error**: In the sentence ""The results of cosine similarity between input and output are shown in image (B),"" the phrase ""in image (B)"" should be consistent with the rest of the text. If ""image (B)"" is a specific reference, ensure it is clear what it refers to.

3. **Unidiomatic Expression**: The phrase ""the quality of the generated video is significantly degraded when only one attention block is removed"" could be rephrased for clarity. Consider ""the quality of the generated video significantly decreases when even a single attention block is removed.""

4. **Agreement Error**: In the sentence ""The assumption is that the more the video changes, i.e., the higher the FVD, the more important the removed block is considered to be,"" the phrase ""the more important the removed block is considered to be"" could be simplified to ""the more important the removed block is.""

5. **Miscellaneous Error**: The phrase ""Layers were deleted according to a sequence, and distillation was performed using the data"" could be clarified. Consider rephrasing to ""Layers were deleted sequentially, and distillation was performed using the data.""

Overall, the text is well-written, but these minor adjustments can enhance clarity and readability.","<total_errors:05><preposition_errors:00><morphology_errors:00><determiner_errors:00><tense-aspect_errors:00><agreement_errors:01><syntax_errors:01><punctuation_errors:01><spelling_errors:00><unidiomatic_errors:01><multiple_errors:00><miscellaneous_errors:01>","<certainty:95>","<total_errors:05><preposition_errors:00><morphology_errors:00><determiner_errors:00><tense-aspect_errors:00><agreement_errors:01><syntax_errors:01><punctuation_errors:01><spelling_errors:00><unidiomatic_errors:01><multiple_errors:00><miscellaneous_errors:01>","The text you provided is mostly clear and well-structured, but there are a few areas where minor improvements can be made for clarity and grammatical accuracy:

Revised text with corrections:

To create a lighter model, we aim to identify and eliminate the parts of the motion module that contribute the most to latency. In [3], where pruning was applied to the Stable Diffusion model, latency was measured not based on neurons or layers in a neural network, but on transformer-based blocks, and unnecessary components were removed accordingly. To prune the motion module, we employed two approaches. First, we examined the structure of the motion module to identify units for pruning. As shown on the right, the motion module is composed of multiple layers within each block. To determine which units to prune, we measured the cosine similarity between the input and output based on transformer blocks and transformer layers. The underlying assumption here is that unnecessary components will have a high cosine similarity between their input and output. The results of cosine similarity between input and output are shown in image B. Specifically, (1) Transformer Temporal Model has similarity values ranging from 0.6 to 0.93, whereas (2) Basic Transformer Block has similarity values ranging from 0.15 to 0.53, and (3) has values ranging from 0.02 to 0.51, which are relatively low. This suggests that the Transformer Block may have considerable redundancy. In practice, when several blocks of (1) were removed, the performance in video generation was superior compared to removing fewer blocks of the small motion attention in (3). As shown in image C, the quality of the generated video is significantly degraded when only one attention block is removed. To determine how many attention blocks to remove, we decided to delete blocks one by one from the original motion module and evaluate the performance. Since the motion module has a total of 21 blocks, this results in 21 variations of the module after deletion. By measuring the FVD (Frechet Video Distance) of the videos generated by the original motion module and those generated after deleting each block, we aim to assess how the video changes with block removal. The assumption is that the greater the change in the video, i.e., the higher the FVD, the more important the removed block is considered to be. Layers were deleted according to a sequence, and distillation was performed using the data. The performance at that time was checked to determine the extent to which layers should be deleted.","<total_errors:04><preposition_errors:00><morphology_errors:00><determiner_errors:00><tense-aspect_errors:00><agreement_errors:00><syntax_errors:01><punctuation_errors:01><spelling_errors:00><unidiomatic_errors:02><multiple_errors:00><miscellaneous_errors:00>","<certainty:95>","<total_errors:04><preposition_errors:00><morphology_errors:00><determiner_errors:00><tense-aspect_errors:00><agreement_errors:00><syntax_errors:01><punctuation_errors:01><spelling_errors:00><unidiomatic_errors:02><multiple_errors:00><miscellaneous_errors:00>","Here is a detailed explanation of each identified error:

1. **Agreement Error**: In the sentence ""The assumption is that the more the video changes, i.e., the higher the FVD, the more important the removed block is considered to be,"" the phrase ""the more important the removed block is considered to be"" could be simplified to ""the more important the removed block is."" This adjustment ensures subject-verb agreement and clarity.

2. **Syntax Error**: The sentence ""Layers were deleted according to a sequence, and distillation was performed using the data"" could be rephrased for clarity. Consider ""Layers were deleted sequentially, and distillation was performed using the data."" This change improves the sentence structure.

3. **Punctuation Error**: In the sentence ""As shown on the right, the motion module is composed of multiple layers within each block,"" the phrase ""as shown on the right"" could be clarified with additional context or removed if it refers to a visual not included in the text. This ensures the punctuation and context are clear.

4. **Unidiomatic Error**: The phrase ""the quality of the generated video is significantly degraded when only one attention block is removed"" could be rephrased for clarity. Consider ""the quality of the generated video significantly decreases when even a single attention block is removed."" This makes the expression more idiomatic.

5. **Miscellaneous Error**: The phrase ""The results of cosine similarity between input and output are shown in image (B)"" should be consistent with the rest of the text. If ""image (B)"" is a specific reference, ensure it is clear what it refers to. This error is categorized as miscellaneous due to its unique nature.

These explanations provide clarity on the types of errors and the suggested corrections.","Here is a detailed explanation of each error identified in the text:

1. **Syntax Error**: 
   - Original: ""As can be seen in image C, the quality of the generated video is significantly degraded when only one attention block is removed.""
   - Explanation: The phrase ""As can be seen"" is slightly awkward and can be improved for clarity. A more natural phrasing would be ""As shown in image C,"" which provides a smoother transition and clearer meaning.

2. **Punctuation Error**: 
   - Original: ""The results of cosine similarity between input and output are shown in image (B).""
   - Explanation: The use of parentheses around the letter ""B"" is unnecessary in this context. It should be written as ""image B"" without parentheses, unless it is part of a specific notation or reference style.

3. **Unidiomatic Error**: 
   - Original: ""The level up to which layers should be deleted.""
   - Explanation: The phrase ""the level up to which layers should be deleted"" is awkward and not idiomatic. A more natural expression would be ""the extent to which layers should be deleted.""

4. **Unidiomatic Error**: 
   - Original: ""The assumption is that the more the video changes, i.e., the higher the FVD, the more important the removed block is considered to be.""
   - Explanation: The phrase ""the more the video changes"" could be clearer. A more idiomatic expression would be ""the greater the change in the video,"" which conveys the intended meaning more effectively.

These corrections aim to enhance the clarity and readability of the text while ensuring it adheres to standard English grammar conventions.","To create a lighter model, we aim to identify and eliminate the parts of the motion module that contribute the most to latency.
