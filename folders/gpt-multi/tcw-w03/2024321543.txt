Since the introduction of flexible electrodes in the early 2000s, substantial progress has been made in the field of wearable electrochemical biosensors, as numerous biosensor prototypes have been developed to detect biomarkers in biofluids other than blood; e.g., sweat, tears, and interstitial fluid, in a minimally invasive or non-invasive manner. Amongst various biosensors, notable research on flexible and wearable glucose sensors has been published over the past decade, seeking to overcome the limitations of current rigid and invasive glucose monitoring devices, after the first fully integrated wearable patch-based epidermal sensors were introduced in 2016, capable of detecting glucose concentration in sweat. The first fully integrated wearable patch-based epidermal sensors were introduced in 2016, capable of detecting glucose concentration in sweat, because sweat can be easily obtained in abundant quantities, making it a viable biomarker detection alternative to blood. This publication demonstrated that sweat could be a viable biomarker detection alternative to blood, given the extent to which sweat can be easily obtained in abundant quantities, making the patch-based sensor type a desirable option for a non-invasive wearable sensor, when technologies such as microfluidic systems were later introduced to minimize contamination and ensure accurate readings of sweat, which has shown potential for stable data sensing under various environmental conditions of sweat samples (e.g., changes in temperature, humidity, and physical activity). In 2022, an epidermal platform to stimulate, collect, and analyze glucose levels in sweat using a single integrated device was introduced, which combined sweat stimulation through the transdermal delivery of pilocarpine using the iontophoresis process via skin conformal elastomer. Building on these technological advancements, I plan to develop next-generation continuous wearable glucose sensors with improved sensitivity and durability to accurately sense glucose level trends over several weeks.
