Assistant config: {'model': 'gpt-4o', 'temperature': 0, 'messages': [{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a English language educator. You are trying to help English language learners improve the grammatical accuracy of their writing. A grammar error is any issue within a sentence that makes it difficult to understand. Punctuation errors are related to the incorrect use of punctuation marks (e.g., periods, commas, semicolons, quotation marks) in sentences. Syntax errors involve issues with sentence structure or word order. Preposition errors involve the incorrect use of prepositions, which are words that show the relationship between nouns or pronouns and other elements in a sentence (e.g., “in,” “on,” “at,” “by”). Tense/aspect errors are related to the incorrect use of verb tenses (past, present, future) or aspects (e.g., progressive, perfect), which indicate the time and duration of an action. Spelling errors involve the incorrect spelling of words. Unidiomatic errors occur where phrases or expressions were not used in a natural or standard way according to the conventions of the language. Agreement errors involve the lack of agreement between subject and verb (subject-verb agreement) or between nouns and pronouns (pronoun-antecedent agreement). Determiner errors are related to the incorrect use of determiners (e.g., “a,” “an,” “the,” “some,” “this”) that introduce nouns. Morphology errors involve the incorrect formation or inflection of words, including issues with prefixes, suffixes, or word roots. Miscellaneous errors are those that do not fit neatly into other categories, often including a variety of uncommon or unique issues. Multiple errors are instances where more than one type of error occurs in the same sentence or phrase, making it difficult to categorize under a single error type.'}]}

Please check for any grammar errors in the following text: Since the introduction of flexible electrodes in the early 2000s, substantial progress has been made in the field of wearable electrochemical biosensors, as numerous biosensor prototypes have been developed to detect biomarkers in biofluids other than blood; e.g., sweat, tears, and interstitial fluid, in a minimally invasive or non-invasive manner. Amongst various biosensors, notable research on flexible and wearable glucose sensors has been published over the past decade, seeking to overcome the limitations of current rigid and invasive glucose monitoring devices, after the first fully integrated wearable patch-based epidermal sensors were introduced in 2016, capable of detecting glucose concentration in sweat. The first fully integrated wearable patch-based epidermal sensors were introduced in 2016, capable of detecting glucose concentration in sweat, because sweat can be easily obtained in abundant quantities, making it a viable biomarker detection alternative to blood. This publication demonstrated that sweat could be a viable biomarker detection alternative to blood, given the extent to which sweat can be easily obtained in abundant quantities, making the patch-based sensor type a desirable option for a non-invasive wearable sensor, when technologies such as microfluidic systems were later introduced to minimize contamination and ensure accurate readings of sweat, which has shown potential for stable data sensing under various environmental conditions of sweat samples (e.g., changes in temperature, humidity, and physical activity). In 2022, an epidermal platform to stimulate, collect, and analyze glucose levels in sweat using a single integrated device was introduced, which combined sweat stimulation through the transdermal delivery of pilocarpine using the iontophoresis process via skin conformal elastomer. Building on these technological advancements, I plan to develop next-generation continuous wearable glucose sensors with improved sensitivity and durability to accurately sense glucose level trends over several weeks.
