Revised Paragraph:

Next, I'll provide some notable literature, followed by a concept map. Later, I'll discuss research methods, measurement, and results, closing with a discussion of strengths and limitations. Large language models should respond in a safer and more trustworthy manner to users' inquiries. Recently, large language models, including GPT-4 and Claude-3.5, have demonstrated more powerful capabilities to answer users' questions in a wide variety of cases. Despite their astonishing performance, several critical problems have been reported, which imply that LLMs are not fully reliable yet. One common type of failure is that LLMs generate different answers for identical questions. This difference results from the nature of deep learning-based AI models, including LLMs, such that outputs from models are computed via stochastic processes. In detail, every token, which is the unit of language that LLMs process, is sampled with a probability conditioned on the input and the previous tokens. Starting with the first token of the input, LLM generates a token, then the second input is the concatenation of the first token and the generated token, and the process is done iteratively until the end of the sentence is generated. Each token is sampled with some probability, and there is the case that the sentence could diverge and end up generating a semantically different sentence, since each token probability is conditioned by previously generated tokens. This non-determinism leads to the concept of uncertainty, which concerns the extent to which models are unsure of their answers. The ideal uncertainty quantification would precisely predict the accuracy of generated responses compared to the actual ground truth. Recently increased demand for assessing LLMs' uncertainty is directly related to the reliability and truthfulness of AI models. Furthermore, special-purpose LLMs such as legal or medical LLMs must be perceived as trustworthy by users, but they may generate erroneous responses. Until recently researchers have sought to quantify uncertainty precisely, yet the quantification performance is unsatisfactory or the application scope is limited to multiple-choice questions.

Revised Paragraph:

AI has become not only a technology but also an essential part of our daily lives, especially with the introduction of generative AI [1]. Today, I would like to talk about recent highly acclaimed on-device AI generation models. The order of the presentation is as follows. First, I'll briefly explain what on-device video models are and what requirements are needed for them. Next, I'll describe which parts of the model were pruned to implement a lighter model and why those specific methods were used. Finally, I'll outline how the model's performance was recovered through distillation, including a brief description of the methods used. For an on-device AI video generative model, fast inference and a lightweight model are of key importance. Recently, video generation models based on stable diffusion have shown impressive performance. These models are designed so that motion modules can be added to the stable diffusion framework in a plug-and-play manner. However, these models share the limitations of stable diffusion, such as slow inference time and large model sizes. To overcome these limitations, there have been significant efforts in the field of text-to-image models to develop faster and lighter models. For example, the LCM module [1] was developed to enable faster inference, and AnimateLCM [2] is a video generation model that supports such fast inference. However, there has been relatively little research on lightweight motion modules so far. In this study, we explore ways to build a more lightweight motion module in video generation models based on stable diffusion. Our research begins with the AnimateLCM model. More specifically, we try to reduce the redundancy by pruning unimportant blocks and compensating for the teacher model's performance through distillation.","@12@ !0! #0# €2€ %0% ^2^ &1& £6£ ~1~ +0+ =0= ₩0₩

Revised Paragraph:

AI has become not only a technology but also an essential part of our daily lives, especially with the introduction of generative AI [1]. Today, I would like to talk about recent highly acclaimed on-device AI generation models. The order of the presentation is as follows: First, I'll briefly explain what on-device video models are and what requirements are needed for them. Next, I'll describe which parts of the model were pruned to implement a lighter model and why those specific methods were used. Finally, I'll outline how the model's performance was recovered through distillation, including a brief description of the methods used. For on-device AI video generative models, fast inference and lightweight models are of key importance. Recently, video generation models based on stable diffusion have shown impressive performance. These models are designed so that motion modules can be added to the stable diffusion framework in a plug-and-play manner. However, these models share the limitations of stable diffusion, such as slow inference time and large model sizes. To overcome these limitations, there have been significant efforts in the field of text-to-image models to develop faster and lighter models. For example, the LCM module [1] was developed to enable faster inference, and AnimateLCM [2] is a video generation model that supports such fast inference. However, there has been relatively little research on lightweight motion modules so far. In this study, we explore ways to build a more lightweight motion module in video generation models based on stable diffusion. Our research begins with the AnimateLCM model. More specifically, we try to reduce the redundancy by pruning unimportant blocks and compensate for the teacher model's performance through distillation."

Revised Paragraph:

Today, I'm going to talk about uncertainty in large language models. First, I will address causes of uncertainty in LLMs, then I'll present the research purpose with motivations. Next, I'll provide some notable literature, followed by a concept map. Later, I'll discuss research methods, measurement, and results, closing with a discussion of strengths and limitations. Large language models should respond in a safer and more trustworthy manner to users' inquiries. Recently, large language models, including GPT-4 and Claude-3.5, have demonstrated more powerful capabilities to answer users' questions in a wide variety of cases. Despite their astonishing performance, several critical problems have been reported, which imply that LLMs are not fully reliable yet. One common type of failure is that LLMs generate different answers for identical questions. This difference results from the nature of deep learning-based AI models, including LLMs, such that outputs from models are computed via stochastic processes. In detail, every token, which is the unit of language that LLMs process, is sampled with a probability conditioned on the input and the previous tokens. Starting with the first token of the input, LLM generates a token, then the second input is the concatenation of the first token and the generated token, and the process is done iteratively until the end of the sentence is generated. Each token is sampled with some probability, and there is the case that the sentence could diverge and end up generating a semantically different sentence, since each token probability is conditioned by previously generated tokens. This non-determinism leads to the concept of uncertainty, which concerns the extent to which models are unsure of their answers. The ideal uncertainty quantification would precisely predict the accuracy of generated responses compared to the actual ground truth. Recently, increased demand for assessing LLMs' uncertainty is directly related to the reliability and truthfulness of AI models. Special-purpose LLMs such as legal or medical LLMs must be perceived as trustworthy by users but may generate erroneous responses. Researchers have sought to quantify uncertainty precisely, yet the quantification performance is unsatisfactory, or the application scope is limited to multiple-choice questions. These limitations have driven the need to develop novel, more effective methods for accurately quantifying uncertainty, particularly in complex, open-ended tasks.","£4£ €3€ ^1^ &3& ~3~ !0! #0# %0% +1+ =0= ₩0₩

One common type of failure is that LLMs generate different answers for identical questions. This difference results from the nature of deep learning-based AI models, including LLMs, such that outputs from models are computed via stochastic processes. In detail, every token, which is the unit of language that LLMs process, is sampled with a probability conditioned on the input and the previous tokens. Starting with the first token of the input, an LLM generates a token, then the second input is the concatenation of the first token and the generated token, and the process is done iteratively until the end of the sentence is generated. Each token is sampled with some probability, and there is a case where the sentence could diverge and end up generating a semantically different sentence since each token probability is conditioned by previously generated tokens. This non-determinism leads to the concept of uncertainty, which concerns the extent to which models are unsure of their answers. The ideal uncertainty quantification would precisely predict the accuracy of generated responses compared to the actual ground truth. The recent increase in demand for assessing LLMs' uncertainty is directly related to the reliability and truthfulness of AI models. More to the point, special-purpose LLMs, such as legal or medical LLMs, must be perceived as trustworthy by users but may generate erroneous responses. Researchers have sought to quantify uncertainty precisely, yet the quantification performance is often unsatisfactory, or the application scope is limited to multiple-choice questions. These limitations have driven the need to develop novel, more effective methods for accurately quantifying uncertainty, particularly in complex, open-ended tasks. In conclusion, addressing these challenges is crucial for enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs in various applications."

AI has become not only a technology but also an essential part of our daily lives, especially with the introduction of generative AI [1]. Today, I would like to talk about recent highly acclaimed on-device AI generation models. The order of the presentation is as follows. First, I'll briefly explain what on-device video models are and what requirements are needed for them. Next, I'll describe which parts of the model were pruned to implement a lighter model and why those specific methods were used. Finally, I'll outline how the model's performance was recovered through distillation, including a brief description of the methods used. For on-device AI video generative models, fast inference and lightweight models are of key importance. Recently, video generation models based on stable diffusion have shown impressive performance. These models are designed so that motion modules can be added to the stable diffusion framework in a plug-and-play manner. However, these models share the limitations of stable diffusion, such as slow inference time and large model sizes. To overcome these limitations, there have been significant efforts in the field of text-to-image models to develop faster and lighter models. For example, the LCM module [1] was developed to enable faster inference, and AnimateLCM [2] is a video generation model that supports such fast inference. However, there has been relatively little research on lightweight motion modules so far. In this study, we explore ways to build a more lightweight motion module in video generation models based on stable diffusion. Our research begins with the AnimateLCM model.
