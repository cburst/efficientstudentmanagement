1. **Punctuation Error**: In the sentence ""Patients have reported adverse effects while using the current CGMs, (e.g., skin irritations caused by strong adhesives, or additional patches including allergens which prevent the rigid device from falling off the curved body surfaces [2]."" there is an unnecessary comma before the parenthesis. The comma should be removed.

2. **Punctuation Error**: In the same sentence, there is a missing closing parenthesis after ""curved body surfaces [2]."" The sentence should be corrected to include the closing parenthesis.

3. **Agreement Error**: In the sentence ""Projects have been conducted to develop flexible CGMs with different biofluids (e.g., sweat, tear, and interstitial fluid); however, commercialization of these platforms has not been successful despite efforts made [3]."" the word ""tear"" should be pluralized to ""tears"" to match the list format and maintain parallel structure.

Revised Paragraph:
My research goal is to develop a flexible wearable glucose sensor platform to overcome the limitations of the current continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems. CGMs have revolutionized the diabetic management market by indicating glucose level trends in a less invasive manner compared to the traditional finger stick method; however, they still have limitations, mainly in relation to sensor rigidity [1]. Patients have reported adverse effects while using the current CGMs (e.g., skin irritations caused by strong adhesives, or additional patches including allergens which prevent the rigid device from falling off the curved body surfaces) [2]. In addition, the CGMs in the market still require needle insertion to place the filament sensor into the body, which causes pain during application. Projects have been conducted to develop flexible CGMs with different biofluids (e.g., sweat, tears, and interstitial fluid); however, commercialization of these platforms has not been successful despite efforts made [3]. By developing CGM platforms that include conformal contact with the skin by utilizing flexible and biocompatible materials, I believe future CGMs can significantly improve the quality of life for many diabetic patients.","@3@
