Revised paragraph:

Wearable biosensors have gained significant interest along with the introduction of commercial wearable smart devices such as the Apple Watch, which collect and analyze biological data such as sleeping patterns and heart rate. With the growing market exposure of wearable devices, demand and expectations for wearable biosensors to collect and analyze more sophisticated bio-data are increasing, especially in measuring continuous glucose levels, which is crucial for successful diabetic management. The global market for wearable glucose monitoring devices is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of around 12.89% [1]. I have chosen the field of wearable biosensors, especially in developing minimal or non-invasive device platforms because I want to study and conduct research in a field where I can contribute to lessening the pain of patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes, who need to continuously monitor their disease every day. I believe that creating a wearable biosensor that detects alternative biofluids other than blood will help many patients with diabetes suffering from pain caused by traditional finger stick tests. However, detecting glucose in biofluids other than blood is challenging due to the low sensitivity and accuracy issues [2]. Therefore, improving sensors by adopting novel designs, materials, and fabrication methods for different biofluids can be one of the areas that I could contribute to resolving the issues related to minimally or non-invasively wearable biosensors.","!2! #1# €1€ %1% ^3^ &1& £1£ ~0~ +0+ =0= ₩0₩

I believe that creating a wearable biosensor that detects alternative biofluids other than blood will help many patients with diabetes suffering from pain caused by traditional finger stick tests. However, detecting glucose in biofluids other than blood is challenging due to the low sensitivity and accuracy issues [2]. Therefore, improving sensors by adopting novel designs, materials, and fabrication methods for different biofluids can be one of the areas that I could contribute to resolving the issues related to minimally or non-invasively wearable biosensors.","!2! #1# €1€ %1% ^3^ &1& £1£ ~0~ +1+ =0= ₩0₩ @11@

Revised paragraph:

Wearable biosensors have gained significant interest along with the introduction of commercial wearable smart devices such as the Apple Watch, which collect and analyze biological data such as sleeping patterns and heart rate. With the growing market exposure of wearable devices, demand and expectations for wearable biosensors to collect and analyze more sophisticated bio-data are increasing, especially in measuring continuous glucose levels, which is crucial for successful diabetic management. The global market for wearable glucose monitoring devices is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of around 12.89% [1]. I have chosen the field of wearable biosensors, especially in developing minimal or non-invasive device platforms because I want to study and conduct research in a field where I can contribute to lessen the pain of patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes, who need to continuously monitor their disease every day. I believe that creating a wearable biosensor that detects alternative biofluids other than blood will help many patients with diabetes suffering from pain caused by traditional finger stick tests. However, detecting glucose in biofluids other than blood is challenging due to the low sensitivity and accuracy issues [2]. Therefore, improving sensors by adopting novel designs, materials, and fabrication methods for different biofluids can be one of the areas that I could contribute to resolving the issues related to minimally or non-invasively wearable biosensors."
