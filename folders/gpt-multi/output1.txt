There are @8@ grammar mistakes in the paragraph. Here is the explanation for each mistake:

1. **Punctuation error**: The first sentence should have a comma before the word "including" to separate the clause properly.
2. **Punctuation error**: The first sentence should have a period after the citation "[ref]" to end the sentence.
3. **Syntax error**: The phrase "decision of cancer treatment" should be rephrased to "decision-making for cancer treatment" for clarity.
4. **Agreement error**: The phrase "improved prognosis of patients" should be "improved prognoses of patients" to match the plural form.
5. **Syntax error**: The phrase "one limitation that RMs consist of" should be rephrased to "one limitation: RMs consist of" for clarity.
6. **Syntax error**: The phrase "become widely used" should be "have become widely used" to match the present perfect tense.
7. **Preposition error**: The phrase "in patients’ blood draws" should be "from patients’ blood draws" to correctly indicate the source.
8. **Unidiomatic error**: The phrase "this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results" should be rephrased to "this study suggests using nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to better reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results" for a more natural expression.

Revised paragraph:
Several epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene variants are highly associated with many cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, which is the second-most common lung cancer type worldwide. Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision-making for cancer treatment, and improved prognoses of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation: RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from patients’ blood draws, have become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study suggests using nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to better reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.
