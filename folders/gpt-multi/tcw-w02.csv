2024321543,"The text is mostly well-written, but there are a few areas that could be improved for grammatical accuracy and clarity:

1. **Punctuation Error**: The sentence ""Patients have reported adverse effects while using the current CGMs, (e.g., skin irritations caused by strong adhesives, or additional patches including allergens which prevent the rigid device from falling off the curved body surfaces [2]."" has an unnecessary comma after ""CGMs"" and a misplaced parenthesis.

It should be: ""Projects have been conducted to develop flexible CGMs with different biofluids (e.g., sweat, tears, and interstitial fluid); however, commercialization of these platforms has not been successful despite efforts made [3].""

3. **Punctuation Error**: The semicolon in ""Projects have been conducted to develop flexible CGMs with different biofluids (e.g., sweat, tear, and interstitial fluid); however, commercialization of these platforms has not been successful despite efforts made [3]."" should be followed by a comma for better readability.
