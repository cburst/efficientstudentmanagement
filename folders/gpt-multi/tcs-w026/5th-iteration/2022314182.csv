"2022314182","The text you provided is mostly clear and well-structured, but there are a few areas where minor improvements can be made for clarity and grammatical accuracy:

1. **Punctuation Error**: In the sentence ""In [3], where pruning was applied to the Stable Diffusion model, latency was measured not based on neurons or layers in a neural network, but on transformer-based blocks, and unnecessary components were removed accordingly,"" the comma before ""and unnecessary components"" is unnecessary. It should be removed for better flow.

2. **Syntax Error**: In the sentence ""The results of cosine similarity between input and output are shown in image (B),"" it would be clearer to say ""The results of the cosine similarity between the input and output are shown in image (B).""

3. **Unidiomatic Expression**: The phrase ""As can be seen in image C"" would be more idiomatic as ""As shown in image C.""

4. **Syntax Error**: In the sentence ""The assumption is that the more the video changes, i.e., the higher the FVD, the more important the removed block is considered to be,"" consider rephrasing to ""The assumption is that the more the video changes (i.e., the higher the FVD), the more important the removed block is considered to be."" This improves readability.

5. **Syntax Error**: The sentence ""Layers were deleted according to a sequence, and distillation was performed using the data"" could be clearer. Consider rephrasing to ""Layers were deleted sequentially, and distillation was performed using the data.""

6. **Unidiomatic Expression**: The phrase ""The performance at that time was checked to determine the level up to which layers should be deleted"" could be more idiomatic as ""The performance was checked at each stage to determine how many layers should be deleted.""

Revised text with corrections:

To create a lighter model, we aim to identify and eliminate the parts of the motion module that contribute the most to latency. In [3], where pruning was applied to the Stable Diffusion model, latency was measured not based on neurons or layers in a neural network but on transformer-based blocks, and unnecessary components were removed accordingly. To prune the motion module, we employed two approaches. First, we examined the structure of the motion module to identify units for pruning. As shown on the right, the motion module is composed of multiple layers within each block. To determine which units to prune, we measured the cosine similarity between the input and output based on transformer blocks and transformer layers. The underlying assumption here is that unnecessary components will have a high cosine similarity between their input and output. The results of the cosine similarity between the input and output are shown in image (B). Specifically, (1) Transformer Temporal Model has similarity values ranging from 0.6 to 0.93, whereas (2) Basic Transformer Block has similarity values ranging from 0.15 to 0.53, and (3) has values ranging from 0.02 to 0.51, which are relatively low. This suggests that the Transformer Block may have considerable redundancy. In practice, when several blocks of (1) were removed, the performance in video generation was superior compared to removing fewer blocks of the small motion attention in (3). As shown in image C, the quality of the generated video is significantly degraded when only one attention block is removed. To determine how many attention blocks to remove, we decided to delete blocks one by one from the original motion module and evaluate the performance. Since the motion module has a total of 21 blocks, this results in 21 variations of the module after deletion. By measuring the FVD (Frechet Video Distance) of the videos generated by the original motion module and those generated after deleting each block, we aim to assess how the video changes with block removal. The assumption is that the more the video changes (i.e., the higher the FVD), the more important the removed block is considered to be. Layers were deleted sequentially, and distillation was performed using the data. The performance was checked at each stage to determine how many layers should be deleted.","<total_errors:10><preposition_errors:0><morphology_errors:0><determiner_errors:1><tense-aspect_errors:0><agreement_errors:0><syntax_errors:4><punctuation_errors:1><spelling_errors:0><unidiomatic_errors:3><multiple_errors:0><miscellaneous_errors:1>","<certainty:95>","<total_errors:9><preposition_errors:0><morphology_errors:0><determiner_errors:1><tense-aspect_errors:0><agreement_errors:0><syntax_errors:3><punctuation_errors:1><spelling_errors:0><unidiomatic_errors:3><multiple_errors:0><miscellaneous_errors:1>","1. **Determiner Error**: 
   - **Original**: ""The results of cosine similarity between input and output are shown in image (B).""
   - **Correction**: ""The results of the cosine similarity between the input and output are shown in image (B).""
   - **Explanation**: The definite article ""the"" is needed before ""cosine similarity"" and ""input and output"" to specify the particular similarity and inputs/outputs being discussed.

2. **Syntax Errors**:
   - **Original**: ""In [3], where pruning was applied to the Stable Diffusion model, latency was measured not based on neurons or layers in a neural network, but on transformer-based blocks, and unnecessary components were removed accordingly.""
   - **Correction**: Remove the comma before ""and unnecessary components.""
   - **Explanation**: The comma before ""and unnecessary components"" is unnecessary and disrupts the flow of the sentence.
   
   - **Original**: ""The assumption is that the more the video changes, i.e., the higher the FVD, the more important the removed block is considered to be.""
   - **Correction**: ""The assumption is that the more the video changes (i.e., the higher the FVD), the more important the removed block is considered to be.""
   - **Explanation**: Parentheses are more appropriate for the parenthetical expression ""i.e., the higher the FVD"" to improve readability.

   - **Original**: ""Layers were deleted according to a sequence, and distillation was performed using the data.""
   - **Correction**: ""Layers were deleted sequentially, and distillation was performed using the data.""
   - **Explanation**: The phrase ""according to a sequence"" is awkward; ""sequentially"" is a more concise and clear adverbial form.

3. **Punctuation Error**:
   - **Original**: ""In [3], where pruning was applied to the Stable Diffusion model, latency was measured not based on neurons or layers in a neural network, but on transformer-based blocks, and unnecessary components were removed accordingly.""
   - **Correction**: Remove the comma before ""and unnecessary components.""
   - **Explanation**: The comma before ""and unnecessary components"" is unnecessary and disrupts the flow of the sentence.

4. **Unidiomatic Errors**:
   - **Original**: ""As can be seen in image C, the quality of the generated video is significantly degraded when only one attention block is removed.""
   - **Correction**: ""As shown in image C, the quality of the generated video is significantly degraded when only one attention block is removed.""
   - **Explanation**: ""As shown in"" is a more idiomatic expression than ""As can be seen in.""

   - **Original**: ""The performance at that time was checked to determine the level up to which layers should be deleted.""
   - **Correction**: ""The performance was checked at each stage to determine how many layers should be deleted.""
   - **Explanation**: The phrase ""the level up to which layers should be deleted"" is awkward; ""how many layers should be deleted"" is more natural.

5. **Miscellaneous Error**:
   - **Original**: ""This suggests that the Transformer Block may have considerable redundancy.""
   - **Correction**: ""This suggests that the Basic Transformer Block may have considerable redundancy.""
   - **Explanation**: The sentence refers to a specific type of transformer block, so specifying ""Basic Transformer Block"" is necessary for clarity.","To create a lighter model, we aim to identify and eliminate the parts of the motion module that contribute the most to latency.
