"2022314182","The text you provided is mostly clear and well-structured, but there are a few areas where minor improvements can be made for clarity and grammatical accuracy:

1. **Punctuation Error**: In the sentence ""As shown on the right, the motion module is composed of multiple layers within each block,"" the phrase ""as shown on the right"" could be more clearly connected to the rest of the sentence. Consider rephrasing for clarity if this is part of a larger document with images.

2. **Syntax Error**: In the sentence ""The results of cosine similarity between input and output are shown in image (B),"" the phrase ""in image (B)"" could be more clearly integrated. Consider rephrasing to ""as shown in image (B).""

3. **Unidiomatic Expression**: The phrase ""the quality of the generated video is significantly degraded when only one attention block is removed"" could be more idiomatically expressed as ""the quality of the generated video significantly degrades when even one attention block is removed.""

4. **Syntax Error**: In the sentence ""The assumption is that the more the video changes, i.e., the higher the FVD, the more important the removed block is considered to be,"" the phrase ""the more the video changes"" could be rephrased for clarity. Consider ""the greater the change in the video.""

5. **Syntax Error**: The sentence ""Layers were deleted according to a sequence, and distillation was performed using the data"" could be clearer. Consider rephrasing to ""Layers were deleted sequentially, and distillation was performed using the data.""

Overall, the text is well-written, but these adjustments can enhance clarity and readability.","<total_errors:05><preposition_errors:00><morphology_errors:00><determiner_errors:00><tense-aspect_errors:00><agreement_errors:00><syntax_errors:03><punctuation_errors:01><spelling_errors:00><unidiomatic_errors:01><multiple_errors:00><miscellaneous_errors:00>","<certainty:95>","<total_errors:05><preposition_errors:00><morphology_errors:00><determiner_errors:00><tense-aspect_errors:00><agreement_errors:00><syntax_errors:03><punctuation_errors:01><spelling_errors:00><unidiomatic_errors:01><multiple_errors:00><miscellaneous_errors:00>","1. **Syntax Errors (3 instances)**:
   - **Error 1**: In the sentence ""As shown on the right, the motion module is composed of multiple layers within each block,"" the phrase ""as shown on the right"" could be more clearly connected to the rest of the sentence. If this is part of a larger document with images, ensure that the reference is clear and directly related to the content.
   - **Error 2**: In the sentence ""The results of cosine similarity between input and output are shown in image (B),"" the phrase ""in image (B)"" could be more clearly integrated. Consider rephrasing to ""as shown in image (B)"" for better flow.
   - **Error 3**: The sentence ""Layers were deleted according to a sequence, and distillation was performed using the data"" could be clearer. Consider rephrasing to ""Layers were deleted sequentially, and distillation was performed using the data"" for improved clarity.

2. **Punctuation Error (1 instance)**:
   - **Error**: In the sentence ""The assumption is that the more the video changes, i.e., the higher the FVD, the more important the removed block is considered to be,"" the use of ""i.e.,"" could be replaced with ""i.e.,"" or ""that is,"" to ensure proper punctuation and clarity.

3. **Unidiomatic Error (1 instance)**:
   - **Error**: The phrase ""the quality of the generated video is significantly degraded when only one attention block is removed"" could be more idiomatically expressed as ""the quality of the generated video significantly degrades when even one attention block is removed."" This rephrasing uses a more natural expression in English.","To create a lighter model, we aim to identify and eliminate the parts of the motion module that contribute the most to latency. In [3], where pruning was applied to the Stable Diffusion model, latency was measured not based on neurons or layers in a neural network, but on transformer-based blocks, and unnecessary components were removed accordingly. To prune the motion module, we employed two approaches. First, we examined the structure of the motion module to identify units for pruning. As shown on the right, the motion module is composed of multiple layers within each block. To determine which units to prune, we measured the cosine similarity between the input and output based on transformer blocks and transformer layers. The underlying assumption here is that unnecessary components will have a high cosine similarity between their input and output. The results of cosine similarity between input and output are shown in image (B). Specifically, (1) Transformer Temporal Model has similarity values ranging from 0.6 to 0.93, whereas (2) Basic Transformer Block has similarity values ranging from 0.15 to 0.53, and (3) has values ranging from 0.02 to 0.51, which are relatively low. This suggests that the Transformer Block may have considerable redundancy. In practice, when several blocks of (1) were removed, the performance in video generation was superior compared to removing fewer blocks of the small motion attention in (3). As can be seen in image C, the quality of the generated video significantly degrades when even one attention block is removed. To determine how many attention blocks to remove, we decided to delete blocks one by one from the original motion module and evaluate the performance. Since the motion module has a total of 21 blocks, this results in 21 variations of the module after deletion. By measuring the FVD (Frechet Video Distance) of the videos generated by the original motion module and those generated after deleting each block, we aim to assess how the video changes with block removal. The assumption is that the greater the change in the video, i.e., the higher the FVD, the more important the removed block is considered to be. Layers were deleted sequentially, and distillation was performed using the data. The performance at that time was checked to determine the level up to which layers should be deleted."
