""AI has become not only a technology but also an essential part of our daily lives, especially with the introduction of generative AI [1]. Today, I would like to talk about recent highly acclaimed on-device AI generation models. The order of the presentation is as follows: First, I'll briefly explain what on-device video models are and what requirements are needed for them. Next, I'll describe which parts of the model were pruned to implement a lighter model and why those specific methods were used. Finally, I'll outline how the model's performance was recovered through distillation, including a brief description of the methods used. For on-device AI video generative models, fast inference and lightweight models are of key importance. Recently, video generation models based on stable diffusion have shown impressive performance. These models are designed so that motion modules can be added to the stable diffusion framework in a plug-and-play manner. However, these models share the limitations of stable diffusion, such as slow inference time and large model sizes. To overcome these limitations, there have been significant efforts in the field of text-to-image models to develop faster and lighter models. For example, the LCM module [1] was developed to enable faster inference, and AnimateLCM [2] is a video generation model that supports such fast inference. However, there has been relatively little research on lightweight motion modules so far. In this study, we explore ways to build a more lightweight motion module in video generation models based on stable diffusion. Our research begins with the AnimateLCM model. More specifically, we try to reduce the redundancy by pruning unimportant blocks and compensating for teacher model performance through distillation.""

Corrections made:
1. Added a comma after ""daily lives"" for clarity.
2. Changed ""Ill"" to ""I'll"" for correct contraction.
3. Added a colon after ""as follows"" to introduce the list.
4. Changed ""on device AI video generative model"" to ""on-device AI video generative models"" for subject-verb agreement and consistency.
5. Changed ""light weight model is"" to ""lightweight models are"" for subject-verb agreement and correct adjective form.
6. Added a comma after ""faster inference"" for clarity.
7. Changed ""compensate teacher model performance"" to ""compensating for teacher model performance"" for correct verb form and preposition use.","<total_errors:12><preposition_errors:1><morphology_errors:1><determiner_errors:0><tense-aspect_errors:0><agreement_errors:2><syntax_errors:0><punctuation_errors:6><spelling_errors:0><unidiomatic_errors:0><multiple_errors:2><miscellaneous_errors:0>","<certainty:95>","<total_errors:11><preposition_errors:0><morphology_errors:1><determiner_errors:0><tense-aspect_errors:0><agreement_errors:2><syntax_errors:0><punctuation_errors:6><spelling_errors:0><unidiomatic_errors:0><multiple_errors:2><miscellaneous_errors:0>","Here is a detailed explanation of each error identified in the text:

1. **Punctuation Errors (6):**
   - **Missing Comma:** ""AI has become not only a technology but also an essential part of our daily lives especially with the introduction of generative AI [1]."" A comma is needed after ""lives"" to separate the clauses for clarity.
   - **Missing Comma:** ""The order of the presentation is as follows. First, Ill briefly explain..."" A comma is needed after ""as follows"" to introduce the list.
   - **Contraction Error:** ""Ill"" should be ""I'll"" in both instances where it appears. This is a punctuation error related to the use of apostrophes in contractions.
   - **Missing Comma:** ""For on device AI video generative model, fast inference and light weight model is of key importance."" A comma is needed after ""model"" to separate the introductory phrase.
   - **Missing Comma:** ""For example, the LCM module [1] was developed to enable faster inference and AnimateLCM [2] is a video generation model that supports such fast inference."" A comma is needed after ""inference"" to separate the clauses.

2. **Morphology Error (1):**
   - **Incorrect Form:** ""light weight model"" should be ""lightweight models"" to use the correct compound adjective form and ensure subject-verb agreement.

3. **Agreement Errors (2):**
   - **Subject-Verb Agreement:** ""For on device AI video generative model, fast inference and light weight model is of key importance."" The subject ""fast inference and lightweight models"" is plural, so the verb should be ""are.""
   - **Possessive Form:** ""how the models performance was recovered"" should be ""how the model's performance was recovered"" to correctly use the possessive form.

4. **Multiple Errors (2):**
   - **Contraction and Punctuation:** ""Ill"" should be ""I'll"" in both instances, which involves both punctuation (missing apostrophe) and spelling (incorrect contraction form).
   - **Punctuation and Agreement:** ""For on device AI video generative model, fast inference and light weight model is of key importance."" This sentence contains both a punctuation error (missing comma) and an agreement error (subject-verb agreement).

These errors were identified to improve the grammatical accuracy and clarity of the text.","AI has become not only a technology but also an essential part of our daily lives, especially with the introduction of generative AI [1].
