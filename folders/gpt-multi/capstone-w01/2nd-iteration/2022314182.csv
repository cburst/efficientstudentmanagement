AI has become not only a technology but also an essential part of our daily lives, especially with the introduction of generative AI. Today, I would like to talk about recent highly acclaimed on-device AI generation models. The order of the presentation is as follows: First, I'll briefly explain what on-device video models are and what requirements are needed for them. Next, I'll describe which parts of the model were pruned to implement a lighter model and why those specific methods were used. Finally, I'll outline how the model's performance was recovered through distillation, including a brief description of the methods used. For on-device AI video generative models, fast inference and lightweight models are of key importance. Recently, video generation models based on stable diffusion have shown impressive performance. These models are designed so that motion modules can be added to the stable diffusion framework in a plug-and-play manner. However, these models share the limitations of stable diffusion, such as slow inference time and large model sizes. To overcome these limitations, there have been significant efforts in the field of text-to-image models to develop faster and lighter models. For example, the LCM module was developed to enable faster inference, and AnimateLCM is a video generation model that supports such fast inference. However, there has been relatively little research on lightweight motion modules so far. In this study, we explore ways to build a more lightweight motion module in video generation models based on stable diffusion. Our research begins with the AnimateLCM model. More specifically, we try to reduce the redundancy by pruning unimportant blocks and compensating for teacher model performance through distillation.

Corrections made:
1. Added a comma after ""daily lives"" for clarity.
2. Changed ""Ill"" to ""I'll"" for correct contraction usage.
3. Added a colon after ""as follows"" to introduce the list.
4. Changed ""model's performance"" to include the possessive form.
5. Changed ""on device AI video generative model"" to ""on-device AI video generative models"" for consistency and agreement.
6. Changed ""light weight model is"" to ""lightweight models are"" for agreement.
7. Removed the citation numbers ""[1]"" and ""[2]"" as they were not necessary for the grammatical context.
8. Added ""for"" after ""compensate"" to complete the phrase ""compensating for.""","<total_errors:12>

   - ""on device AI video generative model"" should be ""on-device AI video generative models"" (includes morphology and agreement errors).
   - ""compensate teacher model performance"" should be ""compensating for teacher model performance"" (includes preposition and morphology errors).","1. **Preposition error**:  
   - **Original**: ""compensate teacher model performance""  
   - **Corrected**: ""compensating for teacher model performance""  
   - **Explanation**: The verb ""compensate"" typically requires the preposition ""for"" to indicate what is being compensated. Without ""for,"" the sentence is incomplete and unclear.

2. **Morphology error**:  
   - **Original**: ""light weight""  
   - **Corrected**: ""lightweight""  
   - **Explanation**: ""Lightweight"" is a compound adjective that should be written as one word when describing models. The separate form ""light weight"" is incorrect in this context.

3. **Agreement errors**:  
   - **Original**: ""model is of key importance""  
   - **Corrected**: ""models are of key importance""  
   - **Explanation**: The subject ""models"" is plural, so the verb should also be in the plural form ""are"" to maintain subject-verb agreement.  
   - **Original**: ""model's performance was recovered""  
   - **Corrected**: ""models' performance was recovered""  
   - **Explanation**: The possessive form should match the plural subject ""models,"" so it should be ""models'"" to indicate possession by multiple models.

4. **Punctuation errors**:  
   - **Original**: ""our daily lives especially with the introduction""  
   - **Corrected**: ""our daily lives, especially with the introduction""  
   - **Explanation**: A comma is needed after ""daily lives"" to separate the main clause from the following adverbial phrase for clarity.  
   - **Original**: ""The order of the presentation is as follows.""  
   - **Corrected**: ""The order of the presentation is as follows:""  
   - **Explanation**: A colon is used to introduce a list or explanation that follows a statement.  
   - **Original**: ""Ill briefly explain""  
   - **Corrected**: ""I'll briefly explain""  
   - **Explanation**: The contraction for ""I will"" is ""I'll,"" requiring an apostrophe.  
   - **Original**: ""models performance was recovered""  
   - **Corrected**: ""model's performance was recovered""  
   - **Explanation**: An apostrophe is needed to indicate possession, showing that the performance belongs to the model.  
   - **Original**: ""For example the LCM module""  
   - **Corrected**: ""For example, the LCM module""  
   - **Explanation**: A comma is needed after ""For example"" to separate it from the rest of the sentence.

5. **Multiple errors**:  
   - **Original**: ""on device AI video generative model""  
   - **Corrected**: ""on-device AI video generative models""  
   - **Explanation**: This phrase contains a morphology error (""light weight"" should be ""lightweight"") and an agreement error (singular ""model"" should be plural ""models"" to match the context).  
   - **Original**: ""compensate teacher model performance""  
   - **Corrected**: ""compensating for teacher model performance""  
   - **Explanation**: This phrase contains a preposition error (missing ""for"") and a morphology error (incorrect verb form ""compensate"" should be ""compensating"").","AI has become not only a technology but also an essential part of our daily lives, especially with the introduction of generative AI.
