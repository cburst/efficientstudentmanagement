You are trying to help English language learners improve the grammatical accuracy of their writing. A grammar error is any issue within a sentence that makes it difficult to understand. Punctuation errors are related to the incorrect use of punctuation marks (e.g., periods, commas, semicolons, quotation marks) in sentences. Syntax errors involve issues with sentence structure or word order. Preposition errors involve the incorrect use of prepositions, which are words that show the relationship between nouns or pronouns and other elements in a sentence (e.g., “in,” “on,” “at,” “by”). Tense/aspect errors are related to the incorrect use of verb tenses (past, present, future) or aspects (e.g., progressive, perfect), which indicate the time and duration of an action. Spelling errors involve the incorrect spelling of words. Unidiomatic errors occur where phrases or expressions were not used in a natural or standard way according to the conventions of the language. Agreement errors involve the lack of agreement between subject and verb (subject-verb agreement) or between nouns and pronouns (pronoun-antecedent agreement). Determiner errors are related to the incorrect use of determiners (e.g., “a,” “an,” “the,” “some,” “this”) that introduce nouns. Morphology errors involve the incorrect formation or inflection of words, including issues with prefixes, suffixes, or word roots. Miscellaneous errors are those that do not fit neatly into other categories, often including a variety of uncommon or unique issues. Multiple errors are instances where more than one type of error occurs in the same sentence or phrase, making it difficult to categorize under a single error type.'}]}

In detail, every token, which is the unit of language that LLMs process, is sampled with a probability conditioned on the input and the previous tokens. Starting with a first token of the input, LLM generates a token, then the second input is the concaten ation of the first token and the generated token, and the process is done iteratively until the end of sentence is generated. Each token is sampled with some probability, and there is the case that the sentence could diverge and end up generating a semantically different sentence, since each token probability is conditioned by previously generated tokens. This non-determinism leads to the concept of uncertainty, which concerns the extent to which models are unsure of their answers. The ideal uncertainty quantification would precisely predict the accuracy of generated responses compared to the actual ground truth. Recently increased demand for assessing LLMs uncertainty is directly related to reliability and truthfulness of AI models. More to the point, special-purpose LLMs such as legal or medical LLMs must be perceived as trustworthy by users, but may generate erroneous reponses. Until recently, researchers have sought to quantify uncertainty precisely, yet the quantification performance is unsatisfactory or the application scope is limited to multiple-choice questions. These limitations have driven the need to develop novel, more effective methods for accurately quantifying uncertainty, particularly in complex, open-ended tasks.

1. **"Im" should be "I'm"**: This is a punctuation error. The contraction for "I am" requires an apostrophe.

2. **"causes of an uncertainty" should be "causes of uncertainty"**: This is a determiner error. The article "an" is unnecessary here.

3. **"Ill" should be "I'll"**: This is a punctuation error. The contraction for "I will" requires an apostrophe.

4. **"users inquiries" should be "users' inquiries"**: This is a punctuation error. The possessive form requires an apostrophe.

5. **"Large language models" should be "large language models"**: This is a punctuation error. Consistency in capitalization is needed.

6. **"more powerful capability" should be "more powerful capabilities"**: This is an agreement error. The noun should be plural to match "more."

7. **"users questions" should be "users' questions"**: This is a punctuation error. The possessive form requires an apostrophe.

8. **"concaten ation" should be "concatenation"**: This is a spelling error. The word is split incorrectly.

9. **"end of sentence" should be "end of the sentence"**: This is a determiner error. The article "the" is necessary.

10. **"there is the case that the sentence could diverge" should be "there is a case where the sentence could diverge"**: This is an unidiomatic error. The phrase is not used in a natural way.

11. **"Recently increased demand" should be "The recently increased demand"**: This is a determiner error. The article "The" is necessary.

12. **"reponses" should be "responses"**: This is a spelling error. The word is misspelled.

13. **"LLMs uncertainty" should be "LLMs' uncertainty"**: This is a punctuation error. The possessive form requires an apostrophe.

14. **"truthfulness of AI models" should be "truthfulness of the AI models"**: This is a determiner error. The article "the" is necessary.

15. **"More to the point" could be rephrased as "Moreover,"**: This is an unidiomatic error. The phrase is not used in a natural way.

16. **"Until recently, researchers have sought" should be "Researchers have sought"**: This is a tense-aspect error. The phrase "Until recently" is redundant with the present perfect tense.

17. **"quantification performance is unsatisfactory" should be "quantification performance has been unsatisfactory"**: This is a tense-aspect error. The present perfect tense is needed to indicate an ongoing state.

18. **"the application scope is limited" should be "the application scope has been limited"**: This is a tense-aspect error. The present perfect tense is needed to indicate an ongoing state.
