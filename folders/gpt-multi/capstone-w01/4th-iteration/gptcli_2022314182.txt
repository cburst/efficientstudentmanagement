You are trying to help English language learners improve the grammatical accuracy of their writing. A grammar error is any issue within a sentence that makes it difficult to understand. Punctuation errors are related to the incorrect use of punctuation marks (e.g., periods, commas, semicolons, quotation marks) in sentences. Syntax errors involve issues with sentence structure or word order. Preposition errors involve the incorrect use of prepositions, which are words that show the relationship between nouns or pronouns and other elements in a sentence (e.g., “in,” “on,” “at,” “by”). Tense/aspect errors are related to the incorrect use of verb tenses (past, present, future) or aspects (e.g., progressive, perfect), which indicate the time and duration of an action. Spelling errors involve the incorrect spelling of words. Unidiomatic errors occur where phrases or expressions were not used in a natural or standard way according to the conventions of the language. Agreement errors involve the lack of agreement between subject and verb (subject-verb agreement) or between nouns and pronouns (pronoun-antecedent agreement). Determiner errors are related to the incorrect use of determiners (e.g., “a,” “an,” “the,” “some,” “this”) that introduce nouns. Morphology errors involve the incorrect formation or inflection of words, including issues with prefixes, suffixes, or word roots. Miscellaneous errors are those that do not fit neatly into other categories, often including a variety of uncommon or unique issues. Multiple errors are instances where more than one type of error occurs in the same sentence or phrase, making it difficult to categorize under a single error type.'}]}

Please check for any grammar errors in the following text: AI has become not only a technology but also an essential part of our daily lives especially with the introduction of generative AI [1] . Today, I would like to talk about recent highly acclaimed on-device AI generation models.   The order of the presentation is as follows. First, Ill briefly explain what on-device video models are and what requirements are needed for them. Next, Ill describe which parts of the model were pruned to implement a lighter model and why those specific methods were used. Finally, Ill outline how the models performance was recovered through distillation, including a brief description of the methods used. For on device AI video generative model, fast inference and light weight model is of key importance. Recently, video generation models based on stable diffusion have shown impressive performance. These models are designed so that motion modules can be added to the stable diffusion framework in a plug-and-play manner. However, these models share the limitations of stable diffusion, such as slow inference time and large model sizes. To overcome these limitations, there have been significant efforts in the field of text-to-image models to develop faster and lighter models. For example, the LCM module [1]  was developed to enable faster inference and AnimateLCM [2] is a video generation model that supports such fast inference. However, there has been relatively little research on lightweight motion modules so far. In this study, we explore ways to build a more lightweight motion module in video generation models based on stable diffusion. Our research begins with the AnimateLCM model. More specifically, we try to reduce the redundancy by pruning unimportant blocks and compensate teacher model performance through distillation.
