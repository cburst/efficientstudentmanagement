Can you check the following paragraph, located after the colon, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph: War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified.
