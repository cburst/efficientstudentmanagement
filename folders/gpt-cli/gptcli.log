"For the last two years and several months, all people have been suffering from COVID-19 itself and the related effects of the disease. The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread.

Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

2024-08-25 10:08:38,960 - gptcli-session - INFO - assistant: I apologize for any oversight. Let's carefully review the paragraph again for any additional errors:

Original paragraph:
"Several epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene variants are highly associated with many cancers [ref] including non-small cell lung cancer, which is the second-most common lung cancer type worldwide [ref]. Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results."

Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

Revised paragraph:
For the last two years and several months, people have been suffering from COVID-19 and its related effects. When COVID-19 first occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even had their privacy intruded upon for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms are from the flu. However, now, the response to COVID-19 has faced new conditions. Although the two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that the two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulations for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage COVID-19 variants and future pandemics.

Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else.

Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right.

1. **Syntax error**: "say, A punches another person, say, B" should be "say, A, punches another person, say, B".
2. **Punctuation error**: "B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong" should be "B’s action was not polite and, accordingly, may be morally wrong".
3. **Determiner error**: "this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action" should be "this reason may not be sufficient to justify A’s violent action".
4. **Agreement error**: "the person who conducts violent action" should be "the person who conducts a violent action".

6. **Syntax error**: "War seems like an extended case of violent action" should be "War seems like an extended case of violent actions".

8. **Unidiomatic error**: "the subject of war cannot be specified" should be "the parties involved in a war cannot be specified".

Revised paragraph:

War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A, punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite and, accordingly, may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient to justify A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts a violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve the unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent actions. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone?

Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

Revised paragraph:
For the last two years and several months, everyone has been suffering from COVID-19 itself and its related effects. The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even had their privacy intruded upon for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media explained how different COVID-19 symptoms are from the flu. However, now, the response to COVID-19 has faced a new situation. Although the two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that the two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulations for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemic variants.

Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified.

1. **Syntax error**: "one person, say, A punches another person, say, B" should be "one person, say, A, punches another person, say, B" to correctly set off the phrase "say, A" with commas.
2. **Syntax error**: "B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong" should be "B’s action was not polite and, accordingly, may be morally wrong" to correctly place the commas around "accordingly."
3. **Syntax error**: "Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else" should be "Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts the violent action was already under attack from someone else" to include the definite article "the."
4. **Syntax error**: "A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation" should be "A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstances with conversation" to use the plural form "circumstances."
5. **Syntax error**: "Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack?" should be "Is starting a war justified only in the case that the country which starts a war was already under attack?" to include the definite article "the."
6. **Agreement error**: "the subject of war cannot be specified" should be "the subjects of war cannot be specified" to match the plural form "subjects" with the plural context of war involving multiple parties.

Revised paragraph:

War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A, punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite and, accordingly, may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts the violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstances with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in the case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subjects of war cannot be specified.

2024-08-25 10:35:20,549 - gptcli-session - INFO - assistant: I apologize for any oversight. Let's carefully re-examine the paragraph for any additional errors:

Original paragraph:
"War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong.

Upon re-examination, I found additional errors:

6. **Agreement error**: "the subject of war cannot be specified" should be "the subjects of war cannot be specified" to match the plural form "subjects" with the plural context of war involving multiple parties. (^1^)
7. **Syntax error**: "Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action" should be "Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient to justify A’s violent action" to use the correct infinitive form. (&4&)
8. **Syntax error**: "Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries" should be "Starting a war is a violent action not between individuals, but between countries" to remove the unnecessary comma. (&5&)
9. **Syntax error**: "Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack?" should be "Is starting a war justified only in the case that the country that starts a war was already under attack?" to use "that" instead of "which" for restrictive clauses. (&6&)

Revised paragraph:
War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A, punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite and, accordingly, may be morally wrong.

Syntax errors involve issues with sentence structure or word order. Preposition errors involve the incorrect use of prepositions, which are words that show the relationship between nouns or pronouns and other elements in a sentence (e.g., “in,” “on,” “at,” “by”). Tense/aspect errors are related to the incorrect use of verb tenses (past, present, future) or aspects (e.g., progressive, perfect), which indicate the time and duration of an action. Spelling errors involve the incorrect spelling of words. Unidiomatic errors occur where phrases or expressions were not used in a natural or standard way according to the conventions of the language. Agreement errors involve the lack of agreement between subject and verb (subject-verb agreement) or between nouns and pronouns (pronoun-antecedent agreement).

Agreement errors involve the lack of agreement between subject and verb (subject-verb agreement) or between nouns and pronouns (pronoun-antecedent agreement). Determiner errors are related to the incorrect use of determiners (e.g., “a,” “an,” “the,” “some,” “this”) that introduce nouns. Morphology errors involve the incorrect formation or inflection of words, including issues with prefixes, suffixes, or word roots.

Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified.

Original paragraph:
Several epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene variants are highly associated with many cancers [ref] including non-small cell lung cancer, which is the second-most common lung cancer type worldwide [ref]. Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways.

In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right.

Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

2024-08-25 10:43:05,960 - gptcli-session - INFO - user: Can you check the following paragraph, located after the colon, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph: War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified.

For instance, one person, say, A, punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite and may accordingly be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient to justify A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B.

Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA.

The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

Revised paragraph:
For the last two years and several months, everyone has been suffering from COVID-19 itself and the related effects of the disease. The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the spread of the disease. The earliest infected people even had their privacy intruded upon for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms are from the flu. However, now, the response to COVID-19 has encountered a new situation. Although the two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that the two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulations for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 as well as future pandemics.

There are @8@ grammar mistakes in the paragraph. Here is the explanation for each mistake and the revised paragraph:

1. **Syntax error**: "say, A punches another person, say, B" should be "say, A, punches another person, say, B". (&)
2. **Syntax error**: "B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong" should be "B’s action was not polite and may, accordingly, be morally wrong". (&)
3. **Syntax error**: "Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action" should be "Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient to justify A’s violent action". (&)
4. **Syntax error**: "Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else" should be "Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts the violent action is already under attack from someone else". (&)
5. **Syntax error**: "A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation" should be "A could have attempted to resolve the unpleasant circumstance with conversation". (&)
6. **Syntax error**: "Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack?" should be "Is starting a war justified only if the country that starts the war is already under attack?". (&)
7. **Unidiomatic error**: "I don’t believe that this is right" should be "I don’t believe this is right". (+)
8. **Syntax error**: "the subject of war cannot be specified" should be "the subject of war cannot be as easily specified". (&)

Revised paragraph:
War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A, punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite and may, accordingly, be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient to justify A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts the violent action is already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve the unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only if the country that starts the war is already under attack? I don’t believe this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be as easily specified.

There are @8@ grammar mistakes in the paragraph. Here is the explanation for each mistake:

1. **Punctuation error**: The first sentence should have a comma before "including." (£1£)
2. **Punctuation error**: The first sentence should have a comma before "which." (£2£)
3. **Syntax error**: "decision of cancer treatment" should be "decision-making for cancer treatment." (&1&)
4. **Agreement error**: "improved prognosis of patients" should be "improved prognoses for patients." (^1^)
5. **Syntax error**: "one limitation that RMs consist of" should be "one limitation: RMs consist of." (&2&)
6. **Tense/aspect error**: "become widely used" should be "have become widely used." (%1%)
7. **Preposition error**: "in patients’ blood draws" should be "from patients’ blood draws." (!1!)
8. **Unidiomatic error**: "this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results" should be "this study suggests using nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to better reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results." (+1+)

Revised paragraph:
Several epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene variants are highly associated with many cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, which is the second-most common lung cancer type worldwide [ref]. Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision-making for cancer treatment, and improved prognoses for patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation: RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from patients’ blood draws, have become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study suggests using nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to better reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.

2024-08-25 10:46:38,712 - gptcli-session - INFO - user: Can you check the following paragraph, located after the colon, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph: War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified.
