SH	Several epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene variants are highly associated with many cancers [ref] including non-small cell lung cancer, which is the second-most common lung cancer type worldwide [ref]. Notably, gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso), well-known anti-cancer drugs, were developed to inhibit EGFR-related cell signaling pathways. Given the clinical importance of EGFR variants, detecting or monitoring these critical variants facilitates the diagnosis of cancers, decision of cancer treatment, and improved prognosis of patients. Therefore, EGFR reference materials (RMs) have been developed in several national metrology institutes and companies. However, commercially available EGFR RMs commonly possess one limitation that RMs consist of genomic DNA (gDNA) or artificially fragmented gDNA. Since liquid biopsies, which detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from entire cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients’ blood draws, become widely used in routine clinical laboratories for screening cancers, EGFR RMs are expected to contain EGFR variants in cfDNA-like forms. As cfDNA is derived from nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), this study will suggest nucleosomal DNA (nDNA) for EGFR RMs to reflect patients’ liquid biopsy results.
AL	For the last two years and several months, all people have been suffering from COVID-19 itself and the related effects of the disease. The first time COVID-19 occurred, the Korean government and citizens were confused about finding the most effective way to trace and prevent the disease's spread. The earliest infected people even got intruded on their privacy for the public interest. Moreover, many healthcare professionals and media introduced how different COVID-19 symptoms from the flu are. However, now, action for COVID-19 has faced a new condition. Although those two diseases still have some differences, experts encourage people to spend less time worrying about the differences and more time healing (Covid Clinic, 2022). Moreover, they also say that two diseases are extremely manageable except for people who are not reasonably healthy, just by eating and sleeping well (Covid Clinic, 2022). From this point of view, it would be natural to get less aggressive regarding regulation for COVID-19. Thus, this essay will address how the Korean government should manage variants of COVID-19 and future pandemics.
SJ	War can never be morally justified. Many people concede that violent action cannot be justified in most situations. For instance, one person, say, A punches another person, say, B, because B made fun of A. In this case, people seem to agree that B’s action was not polite, and accordingly may be morally wrong. Nonetheless, this reason may not be sufficient for justifying A’s violent action. B did wrong, but still A shouldn’t have punched B. Violent action can be justified only if the person who conducts violent action was already under attack from someone else. Even though B made fun of A, and this seems morally wrong, A could have attempted to resolve A’s unpleasant circumstance with conversation. War seems like an extended case of violent action. Starting a war is a violent action, not between individuals, but between countries. However, is it right to apply the same moral standard to war just because starting a war is analogous to punching someone? Is starting a war justified only in case that the country which starts a war was already under attack? I don’t believe that this is right. Unlike the case of violence between individuals, the subject of war cannot be specified.
