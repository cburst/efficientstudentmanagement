Can you check the following paragraph, which is enclosed by brackets, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph - [ This research project aims to improve the understanding of the HYPONASTIC LEAVES1 (HYL1) plant protein in terms of photomorphogenesis. Through different experiments, the function of HYL1 in the photomorphogenic pathway, its evolution, and the localisation within the protein will be explored.    The functionality of HYL1 can be observed by comparing the hypocotyl lengths of different plant lines in blue light and dark conditions. The wild-type (WT) strain and HYL1 mutant (hyl1-2) strain will be compared to establish the presence of the photomorphogenic function of HYL1. Then, the evolution of the photomorphogenic function of HYL1 can be explored by comparing the hypocotyl lengths of Marchantia polymorpha (M. polymorpha) and Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana), while observing the localisation of the photomorphogenic function within the protein through the creation of chimeric transgenic strains combining the N- and C-termini of HYL1 of M. polymorpha and A. thaliana.   Through the comparison of the hypocotyl lengths of the different plant lines with negative (WT strain) and positive controls (hyl1-2 strain), the functionality of HYL1 can be observed.  When considering past papers and the evolutionary context of the photomorphogenic function of HYL1, WT and A. thaliana hypocotyls should exhibit a photomorphogenic phenotype while the hyl1-2 and M. polymorpha hypocotyls should reveal a skotomorphogenic phenotype.   In the context of evolution, the exact timing or reasoning behind the acquisition of the photomorphogenic function of HYL1 is challenging to prove, but by implementing negative and positive controls the observations and measurements allow for increased validity.]
