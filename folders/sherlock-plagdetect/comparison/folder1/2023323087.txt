Can you check the following paragraph, which is enclosed by brackets, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph - [  This transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) single crystal synthesis project seeks to achieve performance aims such as improved battery performance, and proper use in field-effect transistors (FETs). For industrial applications, TMDCs were synthesized using the molten salt method, and the material was evaluated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), and battery performance tests.   The growth direction of the single crystal TMDCs was evaluated through XRD, and while the growth direction of the single crystal TMDCs was evaluated through XRD, the anode battery performance test for TMDC materials is similar to other methods to synthesize TMDCs (cite).    Using salt and materials powder (e.g., Metal: Titanium, Chalcogenides Sulfur, Selenium, and Tellurium), the material was synthesized by reacting at 1000 â„ƒ for 24 hours. Under these conditions, salt with a low melting point first melts and becomes a liquid, and TMDCs single crystal grows inside this liquid salt as a solvent.    Ideally, the XRD of TMDCs shows the growth in the z-axis direction from (001) to (005), implying that the crystal structure of the TMDCs is arranged in a regular direction. Furthermore, it was confirmed that TMDCs materials synthesized using molten salt showed electrochemical performance comparable to previous research results.     During the process of synthesizing the sample, there is a problem that the surface of the TMDCs is oxidized due to the influence of water contained in the salt or moisture and oxygen in the atmosphere. Even so, this problem can be compensated if the TMDCs are controlled in the presence of Argon or Nitrogen.]
