Can you check the following paragraph, which is enclosed by brackets, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph - [This research project addresses the loss balancing problem for multi-task learning (MTL), which decides the weight of each task loss. Since the loss of each single task has a different kind, scale, and lower bound, controlling task weights during training is challenging.   This project delves deeply into the loss balancing problem and figures out that aggregation of each task loss is important because the aggregation can reflect the current state of losses, while the weight design is incapable. The proposed method based on the analysis, weighted generalized mean (WGeM), leverages both weight and aggregation designs whereas previous loss balancing methods [1-4] only exploit one.  Measurements:  To evaluate the performance of MTL, the metric can balance the metric of each single task, where each metric has a different scale and order. Following the existing MTL literature [4, 5], Î”p is employed to measure the performance of MTL since it consolidates the performance of each task equally.   WGeM achieves state-of-the-art on NYU-v2 [6] and Cityscapes [7] datasets. Furthermore, the additional experiment shows that WGeM exhibits more stable training rather than previous loss balancing methods, though it only requires marginal computational overhead.  WGeM depends on sensitive hyperparameter tuning as the performance of WGeM significantly varies according to its parameter choice, although population-based training [8] reduces the computational complexity of grid search, which mitigates reliance on hyperparameters.  ]
