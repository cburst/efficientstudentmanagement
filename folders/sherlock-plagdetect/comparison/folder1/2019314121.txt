Can you check the following paragraph, which is enclosed by brackets, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph - [ Cameras are widely used to collect information from the surrounding environment and provide feedback to users, yet they pose a risk to privacy. In this context, lensless imaging, a technique where the lens is replaced by a thin film, has emerged as a promising method for enhancing cybersecurity by encrypting the scene at the hardware level. Although lensless imaging has traditionally focused on recovering scenes from encrypted measurements, this project aims to develop a method that not only enhances the cybersecurity of cameras but also allows them to perform specific imaging tasks, such as estimating the position of humans without direct access to the scene.    Using a mathematical imaging forward model, we will generate simulated measurements from a lensless camera to evaluate the performance of the hardware encryption and the imaging tasks.    Then, a neural network, trained by these simulated measurements, will be employed to estimate the position of humans from the encrypted data without recovering the scene.    Ideally, our lensless cameras will perform imaging tasks as effectively as those using conventional miniaturized lenses, while preventing hackers from directly accessing the scene data. Furthermore, the quantitative and qualitative comparisons demonstrate the superiority of our technique over existing methods in terms of hardware encryption.   However, there remains a degree of uncertainty regarding which film design is optimal for encryption while maintaining the performance of imaging tasks, which invites further studies. ]
