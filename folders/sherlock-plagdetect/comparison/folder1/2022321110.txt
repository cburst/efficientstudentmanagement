Can you check the following paragraph, which is enclosed by brackets, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph - [This research project aims to explore the correlation between cross-border e-commerce development (i.e., online direct overseas sales and online direct overseas purchasing) and the macroeconomic health (i.e., Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Consumer Price Index (CPI), Unemployment Rate (UR) and Balance of Payment (BOP)) in Korea.  Quantitative methods including Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, Johansen Cointegration (JC) test, Granger Causality (GC) test, and Vector Error Correction (VEC) model will be employed.  ADF tests will be firstly used to test whether the unit roots of all variables are stationary. After examining whether there are cointegration relationships among all the variables, independent variables and dependent variables could be confirmed and 2 VEC models will be established respectively.   Establishing 2 VEC models under the premise that all time series data are stationary and there are cointegration relationships or mutual predictive relationships among the variables. The following results could be inferred according to the previous studies [1-2]: for model 1, GDP may exhibit a positive correlation with online direct overseas sales, while other variables such as CPI, BOP, and UR may show negative correlations. For model 2, GDP may be positively correlated with online direct overseas purchasing; in contrast, other variables may be negatively correlated with purchasing.  Firstly, relying solely on two variables, online direct overseas sales and purchasing, may not accurately represent cross-border e-commerce development. Secondly, the statistical data does not cover an optimal timeframe, and this research utilizes only 10-year quarterly data, which may still be insufficient for modeling.  ]
