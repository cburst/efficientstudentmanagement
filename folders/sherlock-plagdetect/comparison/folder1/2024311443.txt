Can you check the following paragraph, which is enclosed by brackets, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph - [This research project aims to identify the node and vector where visual stimulation occurs, focusing on the visual experiences among pedestrians in walking environments. To determine the pedestrian’s activity node, this project will involve observing the pedestrian’s visual experience activities and analyzing photo collections, focusing on Yeonnam-dong.   Bosselmann’s picturesque method will be employed to identify the node and vector of pedestrian visual stimulation in walking environments. Instead of using illustrations as Bosselmann did, collecting photographs will be used to minimize subjectivity.  To measure the node of pedestrian visual stimulation in walking environments, researchers will observe the location where photographs are taken within the site. Subsequently, SNS crawling will be used to collect the photographs of the corresponding location, and these photos will be overlapped and synthesized to determine the direction from which they were taken.  The location where the photographing behavior occurs indicates the point of the pedestrian’s visual interest in walking environments, which is the activity node, contrary to Lynch’s notion of the physical node. Furthermore, conflicts between the path vector and the pedestrian visual stimulus vector may indicate the need for vertical view management in a specific activity node as well as parallel view management in walking environments.   Although there is a time inconsistency between collected activity nodes and SNS photos, extending the duration of SNS crawling can help alleviate the gap in the collected data. ]
