Can you check the following paragraph, which is enclosed by brackets, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph - [This paper proposes an efficiency estimation method for accurate yield measurement in high-density static random access memory (SRAM), which is complex due to its high sensitivity to process variations (e.g., threshold voltage of transistors, channel length etc.).   Bayesian Optimization (BO) effectively searches the most probable failure point (MPFP) of SRAM, which represents the yield of SRAM in the process variation space.    The estimated yield of SRAM using the proposed method compares with the results obtained from brute-force Monte Carlo (BMC) [1] simulations in HSPICE, considered the ideal yield, to verify its accuracy. In addition to verifying the efficiency of the proposed method, the number of simulations in HSPICE is compared with BMC.  Estimated SRAM yield using the proposed MPFP search-based BO does not have an accuracy drop compared to BMC, and the number of simulations in HSPICE decreases effectively by about 20x because BO is an algorithm optimized for reducing the number of simulations [2].  In sub-14nm processes, the number of process variations that affect SRAM yield increases. Consequently, the number of parameters to consider when finding the MPFP from the variation space increases, which means that the advantage of a simulation cost diminishes in the conventional 28nm process.  ]
