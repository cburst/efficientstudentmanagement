Can you check the following paragraph, which is enclosed by brackets, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph - [   Although disease treatment is highly developed, there are still risks during operations, such as inflammation caused by pathogens. To prevent patients from additional operations and surgical infections, this research suggests advanced materials that improve the recovery function of injured nerves and degrade into harmless bioresorbable particles.   Transient devices are designed from metal minerals existing in the body to deliver electrical stimulation and polymers for encapsulation layers. While people consume minerals, devices fabricated with some metals within the body are non-toxic. Furthermore, FDA-approved polymers are synthesized as layers to protect internal electronics from biofluid and ensure stable operations.   The research demonstrates optimum nerve stimulation by classifying rodent models into five groups based on varying electrical stimulation durations. Gene expressions were measured to confirm an enhancement in the recovery of the sciatic nerve, as electrical stimulation facilitates the healing of the transected nerves.    Each rodent group gets electrical stimulation for zero, one, six, and twelve days and ends the experiment fourteen days after surgery. The result demonstrates that six times is the most efficient, as gene expressions are enhanced compared to other rodent groups.     Even though transient electronics can replace operations and decrease the risk of infection caused by avoidable operations, limitations arise concerning material properties. There are some trade-offs during synthesizing polymers. For example, if the polymer has good water barrier properties, it degrades too slowly, causing the device to remain in the body for an unintended extended period.  ]
