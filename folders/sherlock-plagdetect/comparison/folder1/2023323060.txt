Can you check the following paragraph, which is enclosed by brackets, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph - [ This paper aims to improve the error detection capability of Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) used as an error detection code in memory circuits.  Since CRC-n which appends n-bit check data to the original data for error detection can detect all errors that the length is shorter than n, a data reconfiguration method that bounds errors in n-bit will improve the detection capability. Furthermore, for effective detection, the physical characteristics of the most common memory errors indicated by previous studies will be leveraged.  To measure the detection capability, a simulation for common errors will be executed using a programming language. Additionally, the overhead for area, timing, and power in circuit implementation will be assessed using Electronic Design Automation tools.  Ideally, the detection capability for common errors will be significantly enhanced.  The detection capability of the proposed method can be enhanced only when common errors have occurred. Also, an increase in the manufacturing cost caused by extra circuits built into the original circuit will be inevitable.]
