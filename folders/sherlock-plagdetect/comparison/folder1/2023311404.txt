Can you check the following paragraph, which is enclosed by brackets, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph - [ This research aims to develop robotic wearable gloves that balance performance and wearability. While wearability characteristics such as lightweight and comfortable design are critical for real-world applications, conventional robotic gloves have focused on performance characteristics such as output force and range of motion (ROM), using rigid components to ensure efficient force transmission to the fingers. To achieve a balance between performance and wearability, this study proposes integrating a soft actuator (twisted string actuator) and fabric using stitching methods into wearable gloves.  A twisted string actuator (TSA) and fabric-based designs are adapted to wearable gloves to achieve high output force and lightweight design. By integrating the TSA into the fabric using the stitching method, the actuator’s force can be effectively transferred to the fingers, although traditional soft materials used in gloves generally struggle with force transmission.  Quantitative and qualitative methods will be employed to assess output grip force and comfort. Fingertip force measurements conducted on a hand mannequin testbed will estimate grip strength avoiding interference from human subjects’ noise. Additionally, user surveys will be conducted to quantify user’s comfort.    Grip strength and user comfort will increase because fabric-based designs provide comfort to users when the TSA is off, and the stitching method ensures efficient force transmission without loss by strongly combining components when the TSA is on.  Automatic control strategies that detect user intent will be necessary to assist with specific tasks, even though manual control can activate or deactivate TSA.]
