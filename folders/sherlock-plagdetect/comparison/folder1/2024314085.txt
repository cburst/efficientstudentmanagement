Can you check the following paragraph, which is enclosed by brackets, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph - [ This research proposes the estimation method of frequency nadir (FN) in non-defective power systems using matrix perturbation theory. Since intermittent power generations of renewable energy resources (RESs) and load fluctuations weaken power systems, FN estimation is crucial for power system operators to maintain power system stability.  Whenever power system operators obtain power flow data from pre- and post-perturbed systems, perturbations of eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be calculated using matrix perturbation theory. If perturbations in power systems are sufficiently small to neglect the radius of Gershgorinâ€™s circle, total differentials of state equations derived from the linearization of power systems can generate frequency estimation results.  Using DIgSILENT PowerFactory software, the feasibility of the proposed method is tested on the IEEE 39-bus system under stepwise load increments at different locations.  If load variations are small compared with the total loads of power systems, time-domain frequency responses derived from the proposed method follow simulation results. As a result, estimations of FN in frequency responses have small errors, which can be improved by adjusting the estimation performance index of FN.  However, this index should be defined before calculations. Also, the proposed method does not apply to defective power systems. Although the proposed method has limitations, this research proves the validity of matrix perturbation theory in power systems.  ]
