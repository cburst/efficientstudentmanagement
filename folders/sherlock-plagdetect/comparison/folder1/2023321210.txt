Can you check the following paragraph, which is enclosed by brackets, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph - [ This research project aims to prove that water quality increase in inland standing water can help decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and atmospheric pollution caused by climate change. By addressing the correlation between water quality and GHG emissions, this project ultimately guides the development of inland standing water management technologies.   Quantification of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and water quality is necessary. To quantify these environmental factors, field investigations are required in inland standing water (e.g., dams) , where water quality has increased gradually and is accessible to gather as much data as possible. The research data should be accumulated seasonally and yearly, so that consistent data trends can appear.  To measure the correlation of climate change, GHG emissions and water quality in dams, ‘CE-QUAL-W2’ (i.e., a two-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling software) is used. Every field data is employed in the software to produce prediction results in various scenarios with different water quality.  Ideally, GHG emissions will significantly decrease while dams’ water quality improves. Because dams with bad water quality commonly possess much soil organic matter, which produces GHG via microorganisms’ respiration or degradation, dams with bad water quality contribute to atmospheric pollution more than when the dams have better water quality.  The limitation of this project is low data reliability despite the long-term field investigations. Recently, Earth’s environmental conditions have changed frequently and extreme weather often occurs due to climate change, so data beyond the consistent yearly trends needs to be avoided or separately calculated.]
