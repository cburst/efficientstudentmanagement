Can you check the following paragraph, which is enclosed by brackets, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph - [ This research focuses on modeling Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) to deepen our understanding of its operational mechanisms, particularly the filament formation process initiated by the voltage application at the electrode. Through this research, I aim to address the challenges and develop strategies to control filament behavior, thereby enhancing device computational effectiency.  Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) will be employed to build a RRAM model, which is concerned with the nano-scaled filament location, shape dynamics, and size.  This research uses an analog-digital mixed-mode circuit to measure the changes in the computing speed of RRAM. Due to the unique characteristics of RRAM, which exhibits random resistance and behaves similarly to weight in a neural system, we intend to apply RRAM in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and do the simple texts and image recognition tasks to test the accuracy and computational efficiency of the whole system.   Investigating detailed information on filament and impaction when the conditions of filament such as material, structure, and size change, as well as how these impactions cause the difference in RRAM performance, particularly computational speed will show in this research.  The exact theory of the filament material and associated particles remains uncertain, it's difficult to defining and validating the parameters. ]
