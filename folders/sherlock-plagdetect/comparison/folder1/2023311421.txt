Can you check the following paragraph, which is enclosed by brackets, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph - [ As global warming aggravates, Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cell (SOEC) systems that convert water into hydrogen are promising energy conversion devices because of no carbon emissions, such as carbon dioxide. Well-thermally integrated components (e.g., SOEC stacks, heat exchangers, electric heaters) arrangements of the SOEC systems are required since maintaining SOEC systems’ temperature high by optimal component arrangements improves SOEC systems’ performance. The numerical model of SOEC systems should be constructed by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) commercial packages (e.g., ANSYS FLUENT, COMSOL) to design the optimal component arrangements of the entire SOEC systems. After constructing the reference model that exhibits a 500mm distance between SOEC stacks between shell and tube heat exchangers, other models that exhibit different distances between the components are developed. According to the distance between SOEC stacks and heat exchangers, the differences in maximum and minimum temperature of the components will be calculated. After the comparisons with temperature distribution are conducted, the change of heat losses of entire SOEC systems will be calculated. Unless heat exchangers are 800mm away from the SOEC stacks, heat losses increase by 20% more than the reference model, and the average temperature of SOEC stacks decreases by 15%. Although actual production and demonstration of the SOEC system can ensure the numerical model’s reliability, comparing actual systems with the numerical models is not conducted due to the difficulty of the demonstration of the SOEC systems. As computational resources to calculate the model are excessively high, detailed electrochemical reactions couldn’t be considered.]
