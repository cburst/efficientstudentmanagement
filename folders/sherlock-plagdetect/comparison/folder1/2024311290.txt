Can you check the following paragraph, which is enclosed by brackets, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph - [This research project seeks to address the problem of quantizing diffusion models, in which the quantization error accumulates during the sampling (i.e., denoising) process. To alleviate the quantization error, this research project proposes a method to minimize the accumulated quantization error with a novel metric that measures the accumulated quantization error.   To alleviate the accumulated quantization error during the iterative sampling process, this research project proposes a method to optimize an additional bias term in the training phase that finetunes the activation value of each time step (e.g., xt =xt +biast), where the bias term is independent of each time step. From this strategy, a bias term can be interpreted as guidance and provides auxiliary information to a quantizer that leads to accurate and precise quantized results.    Even though the accumulated quantization error is a crucial problem in diffusion models, previous works measured the performance only using the final generated images.   For this reason, this research project also proposes a novel metric that measures the accumulated quantization error by calculating the difference between the full precision model output and the quantized model output of each time step during the denoising process.  With the introduction of the aforementioned method (i.e., applying an additional bias term), the performance increased in both the accumulated quantization error and a traditional metric (i.e., Frechet Inception Distance), which implies that the suggestions of this research project were crucial.  Applying additional bias terms may cause computational complexity, which contradicts the goal of quantization to reduce computational overhead.  ]
