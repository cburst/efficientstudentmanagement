Can you check the following paragraph, which is enclosed by brackets, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph - [ The proposed method seeks to produce state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiframe Super Resolution (MFSR) tasks. To achieve this goal, the proposed method should demonstrate superiority over other existing MFSR methods in terms of fidelity and accuracy. This superiority can only be achieved by an adequate combination of low-resolution (LR) inputs to produce super-resolved (SR) images. The proposed method suggests a novel fusion approach for LR image combinations.  The MFSR metrics are separated into alignment modules and fusion modules. The proposed methods would replace the fusion module of the current SOTA module Burst Super-Resolution Transformer (BSRT).   For precise image quality measurement, both quantitative and qualitative measurements are required. The Peak signal-to-noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) metrics are used to assess different quantitative traits of images (e.g. noise degradation, blur effect). For qualitative measurement, Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) is employed to quantify the evaluation of human visual assessment.  The desired results are expected to illustrate superiority in every image evaluation method, compared to previous modules that solely implemented quantitative measurements. By exploiting the LPIPS measurement with novel fusion metrics, the results would demonstrate superiority in human perception. Furthermore, blur effects and inaccurate pixel alignment would be resolved for visual content results.  The problem of hallucinations might occur in extreme image examples that are included in the training set. To address this issue, a study of image regularization methods is required in future research.]
