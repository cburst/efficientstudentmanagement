Can you check the following paragraph, which is enclosed by brackets, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph - [ This research project seeks to address improvement in the correlation between metrics of Transformer architectures and the architecture’s performance. To improve the correlation, this research project will propose a novel method for measuring indicators with a high correlation with performance without training.   Unlike previously widely used networks such as CNN and RNN, the transformer network largely consists of two modules: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Multi-head Self Attention (MSA). Therefore, when measuring the performance indicators of the transformer architecture in a training-free manner, different measurements suitable for each of these two modules must be applied.  Network pruning is a technology that evaluates the synaptic saliency of a large number of hidden neurons in a neural network and removes neurons of low importance, thereby reducing the weight of the network to lower computational costs while maintaining performance. To measure the initial performance of MLP, synaptic saliency, derived from network pruning, is used. On the other hand, to measure how diverse information the weight of each layer in the MSA module contains, the rank of the weight matrix is ​​measured, and this value is called synaptic diversity.  Compared to existing training-free proxies that do not consider the structural characteristics of the transformer, the metric obtained through the method proposed in this research project has a higher correlation with the performance of the actual architecture.  Since the proposed method measures two independent indicators, synaptic diversity and synaptic saliency, a more appropriate way to integrate these two values ​​theoretically and experimentally is needed. ]
