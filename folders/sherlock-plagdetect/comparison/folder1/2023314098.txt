Can you check the following paragraph, which is enclosed by brackets, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph - [ This research project proposes a 4-bit 3-wire 3-level (4B-3W-3L) pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-3) encoding scheme to utilize a dummy-bit generated when a conventional PAM-3 encoding scheme is used in the memory interface. By utilizing the dummy-bit, the 4B-3W-3L improves signal quality and reduces the power consumption of the driver.  4B-3W-3L reduces the probability of maximum level transition (i.e., transition level 2 to level 0 or vice versa) since it degrades the signal quality and consumes a 4 times larger power than 1-level transition.  To measure performance metrics, an eye-diagram and a transition probability calculation are used. To generate the eye-diagram, the signal is divided into the same period and overlapped. Since the maximum level transition and 1-level transition can be calculated using a bit density of 4B-3W-3L (probability of level 2 is 25%, of level 1 is 50%, and of level 0 is 25%), the power also can be calculated by multiplying the power ratio.  In the measured eye-diagram, the eye-width increases 23% in the upper eye and 7% in the lower eye. Power consumption of the driver is reduced 18.9% in comparison to the conventional PAM-3 encoding scheme.  Vulnerability to per-pin skew limits the versatile use of the 4B-3W-3L. Since 4B-3W-3L adopts a multi-wire signaling method that uses correlated channel outputs, the skew between correlated channels degrades the reliability of the system. To mitigate the effects of the per-pin skew, additional research about de-skewing is needed.]
