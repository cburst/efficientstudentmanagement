Can you check the following paragraph, which is enclosed by brackets, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph - [ Images captured under undesirable conditions such as low light and backlight have fatal impacts on the performances of computer vision tasks especially associated with object detection, recognition, and classification that are essential for autonomous vehicles. Contrast enhancement (CE) techniques try to obtain natural-looking images from the degraded images under undesirable conditions.    Assuming the image degradation systems as simple linear systems has been a prevalent method for CE applications. The proposed research focuses on non-linear approximation of the image degradation systems for the accurate estimation of image degradation systems, thereby obtaining desirable images by inverting the systems.  Although natural image quality evaluator (NIQE) is commonly used, specific quantitative indicators related to natural-looking images do not exist in the field of CE, so ambiguity in the performance of CE algorithms is one of the main challenges in the CE field.    Since the real-world image degradation systems mainly consist of non-linear processes, the techniques based on non-linear approximations of the systems are expected to outperform the previous linear approximations-based CE algorithms. With the substantial increase in CE algorithm performances, computer vision tasks such as object detection and recognition can be applied to images under inadequate light conditions such as low light and backlight.  Since Image degradation systems of each condition differ from each other, establishing an integrated non-linear image degradation system that is invertible is challenging. Therefore, defining various systems for each condition which increases the complexity of algorithms is essential.]
