Can you check the following paragraph, which is enclosed by brackets, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph - [Despite advances in transient electronics in the biomedical field, previous device fabrication technology could only utilize thin metal films [1-2]. Therefore, this research project focuses on enhancing the resolution of laser ablation when structuring electronic components (e.g., coils, electrodes) using thick films with micrometer scales, which would lead to higher controllability of a functional lifetime of electronics.  To improve laser accuracy, this research project suggests a sustainable fabrication method, which incorporates intrinsic adhesive properties of polymer encapsulants in bioresorbable electronics into the laser ablation process. Using an adhesive polymer underlayer, researchers would properly fix materials that lack flexibility during laser ablation [3].  Measurements:         Previous researchers commonly analyzed laser patterns using scanning electron microscopy or atomic force microscopy. Though these tools can provide high-resolution images, they are only capable of measuring the nanometer range. Three-dimensional confocal microscopy would properly characterize the profiles of ablated materials, which are micrometer scales.          When there is no adhesive for fixation, the resolution is about 50 micrometers. After placing an adhesion layer below ablating materials, resolution increases up to 5 micrometers, which is a ten times higher result than before.  First, the criteria for determining the perfect ablation without disrupting the intended feature is ambiguous. Second, this adhesion-assisted method has another variable of stiffness in addition to adhesion energy. Since softness also increases when the adhesion energy of polymers elevates during synthesis, there are difficulties in managing the elastic properties of the polymer, which can undermine the secure fixation of ablated materials during laser processing [4].  ]
