Can you check the following paragraph, which is enclosed by brackets, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph - [Smart farms utilize solar generation to supply electricity, reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, if solar generation produces electricity intermittently, smart farms cannot receive a continuous energy supply. To cover insufficient electricity, using heat pumps and carbon-neutral heat source systems (e.g., wood pellet boilers and absorption chillers) is needed to produce electricity, thus assessing how much less CO2 is produced compared to traditional supplementation from centralized grids.  Environmental and economic methods will be employed to quantitatively calculate CO2 emissions and to realize the long-term operation of smart farms.  Life cycle assessment (LCA) is based on an examination of materials produced and waste released into the environment during their life cycles, which assesses the productâ€™s impact on the environment. Furthermore, economic factors (i.e. initial investment cost, payback period, and net present value (NPV)) will indicate the feasibility of long-term operation.  When operating smart farms using a combination of solar power generation, heat pumps, and wood pellet boilers, CO2 emissions could be reduced by 50% in winter and 65% in summer based on LCA. Also, despite the initial investment cost of additional systems, NPV was 1.5 times higher than using centralized grids.  Depending on where energy sources are produced and how far they are transported, the product may have higher CO2 emissions and costs because of transportation fees and regional characteristics. Furthermore, different countries have various carbon credit prices, so reducing emissions with solar generation instead of using centralized grids may not improve the economy. ]
