Can you check the following paragraph, which is enclosed by brackets, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph - [ This research aims to elucidate internal electrochemical phenomena (e.g., the average temperature of cells, the mole fraction of hydrogen in fuel channels, and the current density of cells) using commercial simulation packages such as ANSYS or COMSOL in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) stacks so that validating the reliability of novel stack designs based on experimental results.  To enhance the accuracy of simulation results, deriving the experimental parameters (i.e., pre-exponential factor and activation energy of exchange current density in the Butler-Volmer equation) via cell characterization is necessary. After cell characterization, by adjusting the stack thermal boundary conditions, the stack voltage of simulations should be aligned with the stack voltage of SOFC experiments.  To secure the experimental parameters for cell characterization, and the stack voltage of experiments, I-V curves (i.e., current-voltage curves) based on cell experiments and stack experiments at various operating conditions should be acquired.   Simulation results showed that the minimum mole fraction of hydrogen should maintain the value of 0.1 to prevent the rapid degradation of stacks since a substantial chemical gradient in the fuel channels can cause severe temperature maldistribution in the stack. Even if the higher fuel utilization can reduce the operation cost of SOFC stacks, the hydrogen mole fraction should retain 0.1 at least.  Although the fidelity of simulation results enhanced by matching the results of experiments, various assumptions in numerical simulations are remain. Since computational resources are limited, adopting reasonable assumptions considering the simulation conditions is crucial.]
