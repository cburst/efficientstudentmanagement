Can you check the following paragraph, which is enclosed by brackets, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph - [ This project aims to synthesize a single layer of Hafnium disulfide (HfS2) in two steps. The well-crystallized HfS2 was produced in the first step by applying the salt flux method. After synthesizing this crystal, because the well-crystallized HfS2 comprises layers held together by van der Waals forces, in exfoliation, the strategy involves intercalating Lithium ions between the layers of the single crystal, the subsequent reaction of the aqueous solution with the Li ions disrupts the van der Waals forces, thereby releasing the layers. The Hafnium, Sulfur, and Sodium chloride (NaCl) act as precursors, which are respectively weighted with a mol ratio of 1:2:10. The chemicals are then stored in a quartz tube, where sealed under vacuum to prevent the oxidation of the chemical. After annealing at 1000 â„ƒ for 24 hours, the HfS2 is collected using aqueous treatment and a drying process in the oven.   The HfS2 is measured by the X-ray Diffraction (XRD) technique to estimate the well-crystallized structure, while the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) captures the morphology of the HfS2.   The powder XRD results for the HfS2 reveal a well-crystallized structure with distinctive diffraction peaks that match the hexagonal structure of the P-3m1 space group. As evidence of the XRD result, the SEM images also show the hexagonal shape of the HfS2.   A significant challenge is the residual NaCl, a byproduct that arises from applying the salt flux method during the synthesis of the HfS2. The removal of NaCl requires aqueous treatment, which may produce unwanted oxidation in the HfS2. ]
