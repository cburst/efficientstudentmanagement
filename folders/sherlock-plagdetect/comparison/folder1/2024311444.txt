Can you check the following paragraph, which is enclosed by brackets, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph - [This research project aims to investigate whether current viewpoints in Seoul adequately reflect the preferences of users and human viewers and whether expert-based approaches align with the actual demands of users and human viewers. As the Han River is the highest-rated landscape in Seoul [1], this research project strategically selects the viewpoints along the Han River.  Quantitative methods will be employed to explore the suitability and attractiveness of Han River viewpoints.  When measuring the suitability and attractiveness of Han River viewpoints, images taken within Han River viewpoint areas will be collected using image mining techniques. After this process, computer vision techniques will be used to identify and extract landscape key elements from the collected images. Additionally, the vitality of these viewpoints will be evaluated by analyzing population mobility data to understand movement patterns and utilization dynamics.  Ideally, the findings of this research project will demonstrate the impact of applying a user-based approach in selecting urban viewpoints to derive locations most preferred or frequently utilized by the public, while highlighting the potential of data-driven approaches such as leveraging big data and spatial analysis in advancing research in the field of urban landscape management. Although the findings of this research project may not fully generalize to all age groups due to the limitation of collecting data from a diverse range of individuals, further studies could develop methods to measure their viewpoints effectively.]
