Can you check the following paragraph, which is enclosed by brackets, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph - [ This paper introduces a novel approach to voltage sensitivity estimation (VSE) using a convolutional neural network (CNN) under conditions of insufficient information. Reconstructing the distribution system's VSE is crucial, as it enables effective operation and control. However, accessing all information (e.g., voltage, current, load) of observation points on power systems is often impractical. Our proposed method, utilizing CNN, offers a fresh perspective on this challenge.   This study estimates voltage sensitivity through CNN, which can capture non-linearity better than conventional statistical methods. The simulation conducted PSS/E that power systems simulation programs.  It was assumed that voltage would be measured only when a solar photovoltaic generator (PV) was installed at all points.  PV measured the voltage, and the VSE was conducted using the measured voltage. The results are validated by comparing the actual VSE calculated by PSS/E with the estimated VSE. VSE is performed in two parts: knowing the information of all points and the information of the point to which PV is connected.  As a result, the proposed method estimated a more accurate VSE than the existing method. Furthermore, conventional statistical methods have been unable to perform VSE with insufficient information, while the proposed method has effectively restored it.   The proposed method has a fundamental limitation of neural networks in that prior training is required. ]
