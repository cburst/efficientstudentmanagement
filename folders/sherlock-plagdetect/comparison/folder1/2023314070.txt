Can you check the following paragraph, which is enclosed by brackets, for grammar mistakes, count the number of mistakes, place the number of grammar mistakes between TWO @ symbols even if the number is zero, explain each of the mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph - [ This research project seeks to address the power overhead caused by input-output sense amplifiers (IOSAs) in dynamic random access memory (DRAM). To mitigate the power of IOSAs, this project will minimize the required input voltage, since a long global IO line (GIO), utilized to transfer data to IOSA, dominates the power consumption of IOSA sensing operations.  The offset cancellation will be employed to minimize the required input voltage for robust IOSA sensing operation, reducing the power consumption to drive GIO.  To measure the minimum input voltage for robust IOSA sensing operations, sensing yield will be measured by sweeping the amount of input voltage. The power consumption of previous IOSAs and the proposed IOSA at 100% sensing yield are compared. Additionally, to analyze the power consumed while driving GIO and the power consumed while IOSA developing output data, the power will be measured separately.   Ideally, offset cancellation techniques, capturing offsets of IOSAs with capacitors, significantly reduce the offset allowing robust sensing with minimized input voltage. As a result, the required GIO voltage is reduced to mitigate the power consumption of IOSA sensing operations.  Although offset cancellation techniques have removed the offset that interferes with IOSA sensing operations, these techniques inevitably transfer input voltage using capacitive coupling which results in input attenuation. To compensate for this attenuation, a larger input voltage is still required increasing the power overhead while driving GIOs. Furthermore, to remove offsets, large capacitors are used resulting in area overhead.  ]
