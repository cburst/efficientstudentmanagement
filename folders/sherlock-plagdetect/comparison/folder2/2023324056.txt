I am researching about image processing. As a lot of image or video based devices demanded, such as autonomous vehicle, the importance of computer vision and image processing technique has increased these days. Such devices try to get a lot of information from images. To get information from images, it is important to get clear, natural, high resolution images from the camera sensors. This is the reason why image processing technique is important. I chose image processing field because autonomous driving technique looks interesting and amazing when I studied about it in many classes. Also, I thought much better technology would be needed in order to be commercialized. Especially, I am interested in enhancing images captured from low light conditions, which is needed for  surveillance camera or autonomous vehicle at night. There are some algorithms that make low light image looks better but itâ€™s performance is not that good to be used in real devices. I aim to develop new algorithms with much better performance.          At the moment, I am conducting research on enhancing contrast of images (i.e. Contrast enhancement, CE). In many cases of image, low light, backlight and haze become problems.  Contrast enhancement is an technique that is applied to degraded images such as low light images or backlight images. Such degraded images make people hard to recognize what is on the image.   At the moment, I am conducting research on enhancing contrast of images (i.e,Contrast enhancement; CE). For many images, low light, backlight and haze become problems. The content of such  images can be difficult to recognize because of low contrast. Contrast enhancement can be applied to degraded images and make images more recognizable. In other words, CE technique makes degraded images into images taken in a normal lighting environment. CE technique is used in many image processing tasks  not only in  normal cameras but also in special cameras such as surveillance cameras. Considering the purpose of surveillance cameras also used at night, it requires much better performance. The purpose of my research is to develop new algorithms that increase performance. Further more, it can be applied to many other cameras used under  dramatic environment.  Contrast enhancement (i.e, CE) is an important technique used everywhere in image processing. The main contribution of CE technique is to make every image looks like daylight images although taken in low light or hazy environment. Many research have been produced to improve the performance of CE technique. Histogram equalization [1] is a basic technique which is widely used in these days but it degrades naturalness of images. Therefore, new algorithms that develop histogram equalization such as adaptive histogram equalization, histogram specification, and 2D histogram specification. Contextual and variational contrast enhancement [2] firstly uses 2D histogram to consider context of images and address unnaturalness problem of histogram equalization. Furthermore, some researches uses retinex theory [3] that is derived from human visual system and decomposes an image into reflectance and illumination. X Guo et al. [4] shows that retinex based algorithm with assumption can effectively enhance low light image. Recently, multi-exposure image fusion technique is being actively researched. C Hessel et al [5] proposed which contain both technique that generating multi exposure images and fusing multi exposure images into single contrast enhanced image.
