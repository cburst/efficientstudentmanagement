  Biomaterials and medical engineering is one of the most promising fields of study. As time progresses and science develops, the span of life increases though disease remains an exception. At the same time paradoxically patients experiencing chronic illness require continuous treatment and monitoring. As a result, the concept of transient electronics has risen.   My research focuses on bioresorbable devices, which are devices that can be fully dissolved after their lifetime in the body without any harmful reaction, and are convenient for patients with chronic diseases. Bioresorbable devices can alleviate the burden of periodic medical visits for patients and help patients avoid additional operations for the removal of internal objects.  More specifically, as a material science and engineering researcher, I am studying how to design and develop devices. The core components of devices include bioresorbable polymers and metals which dissolve into harmless particles.    Developing medical devices represents a promising avenue, particularly as society increasingly prioritizes both longevity and health. Paradoxically, despite advancements enabling longer lifespans of humans, there’s been a rise in chronic disease, leading to heightened demand for periodic hospitalization and continuous illness monitoring, resulting in time and space constraints. Furthermore, additional operations to remove devices in the body increase dangers of unnecessary and avoidable infections. Bioresorbable (i.e, fully dissolved in harmless particles in the body) device has emerged to diminish the burden of patients. The devices show outstanding effectiveness on decreasing time of long-term care and an infection by additional operation. Regarding the function of devices, bioresorbable devices can cause electrical stimulation on nerves to facilitate injured nerve regeneration. The human body exchanges signals between brain and the whole body by electrical stimulation and when the system which exchanges signals is out of order, the function of organs and  tissues doesn’t work. Our focus is on enhancing a recovery function of peripheral nerves through the use of advanced devices. I am researching an advanced device that combines superior effectiveness in stimulation protocols, a wireless network of implantable materials which undergo biodegradation after completing its functional time. The field of bioresorbable electronics begins with a paper published in 2012 by John A. Rogers [1], which broke the perception of silicon as physically invariant, and showed transient forms of silicon electronics, potentially indicating the possibility of silicon-based CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) transient implants. Aside from silicon, a paper published in 2014 demonstrated the use of different dissolvable metals (e.g., Magnesium, Zinc, Iron, Tungsten, Molybdenum, and alloys) for transient electronics [2]. The degree of metal dissolution is controlled by a duration of immersion time. These transient metals can be applied to biomedical fields such as sensors. Sensors made of transient components were developed in 2016 [3]. To reduce the danger of infection by electronic implants and additional operations to remove implants, Choi reports implantable, multifunctional silicon sensors for the brain, for which all of the components are naturally absorbed into the body by hydrolysis and metabolic reaction. The duration for which the device should function inside the body varies depending on the diseases, necessitating control devices' functional stability. To address the hardness of controlling degradation degree. Choi indicated that polyanhydride-based polymers called PBTPA can serve as hydrophobic encapsulation layers to stably preserve devices from hydrolysis by body fluids [4].  Furthermore, to overcome the challenges  associated with matching lifetimes of device and patients’ clinical needs, dynamic covalent polymers called b-DCPU is presented [5]. The polymer named b-DCPU facilitates tight bonding according to dynamic conditions, heat and pressure. b-DCPU-based devices let electrical signal flow along the nerves to improve neuromuscular regeneration.          Transient electronics are specifically designed for use in biomedical applications. Transient electronics can be implanted into the body and gradually degrade into harmless bioresorbable particles through processes like hydrolysis and enzymatic reactions.For instance, ‘Choi et al’ demonstrated a temporary cardiac pacemaker to help patients recover from bradycardia (i.e., a condition where patients' hearts beat slower than normal heart rate) [1]. Electrical stimulation from the pacemaker controls patients’ cardiac rhythm and the device tracks cardiopulmonary status, and enables transient operation with minimal burden to patients. In this manner, transient electronics can be applied to a diverse array of challenges in biomedical engineering. Therefore, this research project will consider the effectiveness of transient electronics and the properties of bioresorbable materials.  RQ1. To what extent can electrical stimulation improve the recovery function of peripheral nerves with respect to the duration of stimulation. RQ2. To what extent can electrical stimulation be used as neuromuscular therapy and recover diseases. RQ3. To what extent can transient electronics operate in the body before degrading into bioresorbable particles.  In this way, this research aims to conduct a comprehensive study on the application of transient electronics as biomedical devices and the methods for controlling material properties. Based on a preliminary research which demonstrated that electrical stimulation improves recovery function of nerves, I would like to research the optimum durations and number of electrical stimulation to recover function of injured nerves [2].              Investigation of transient electronics as biomedical devices began with a paper by J. Koo et al. , demonstrating efficiency of electrical stimulation for recovering peripheral nerves. The paper presented a developed platform for wireless, programmable electrical peripheral nerve stimulation, and reported enhanced neuroregeneration and functional recovery in rodent models following multiple episodes of electrical stimulation of injured nervous tissue. However, J. Koo et al. showed only improvement of restoration ability, excluding the period and quantity of stimulation. Consequently,  this research project aims to establish the optimum nerve stimulation method. Additionally, stimulating the spinal cord can enhance rehabilitation, suggesting the possibility of spinal cord remedy which was previously considered unforeseeable [2]. Transient electronics implanted in the body dissolved harmlessly into bioresorbable particles through hydrolysis and enzymatic reactions, overcoming the necessity of additional operations. To increase reliability of devices and to ensure that devices are in stable working order, polymer encapsulation layers protecting devices from directly in contact with biofluids which induce degradation should be well-synthesized. By adjusting properties (e.g., water barrier property, stretchability, electrical relationships, mechanical properties), the polymer provides stability of biomedical implants. These research will suggest schematic comprehension about how transient electronics can be applied as biomedical devices and how to control the properties of devices to enhance reliability.  To answer the above research questions, investigation into preliminary studies should proceed. J. Koo et al. demonstrated the efficiency of electrical stimulation for recovering injured peripheral nerves in rodent models and presented a developed platform for wireless, programmable nerve stimulation. Taking the result further, this research will show how electrical stimulation mediates nerve treatments by classifying five rodent groups with different duration of stimulation and comparing the degree of recovery. Five groups of rodent models will receive stimuli numbered 0 (control group), one, three, six, and twelve respectively. The injured nerve grafts to be used in the experiment will be isografts (i.e., a tissue or organ transplanted between genetically identical individuals) and the stimulator will be implanted 5 mm proximal to the sciatic nerve (i.e., the confluence of nerve roots from the lower back). The issue of the research is that after the axon starts to grow, electrical stimulation to accelerate growth is not efficient. As a result, we expect that there is an optimum duration of stimulation and the remedy can be applied to not only injured peripheral nerves but also other places in the body such as the spinal cord. Transient electronics (i.e., implanted in the body and degrades into bioresorbable particles without causing infection and inflammation) like electrical stimulators should remain stable during therapeutic period to heal wounds and degrades after fulfilling its function.    Transient electronics, which degrade naturally after its functional time in the body, is a promising alternative approach to medical devices that can replace operations and prevent patients from experiencing avoidable surgical infections. However, limitations often arise in association with the properties of materials, such as polymers serving as encapsulation layers, and metals functioning as electrical stimulators. In terms of synthesizing polymers (e.g., bioresorbable dynamic covalent polyurethane; b-DCPU, polylactic-co-glycolic acid; PLGA), several properties, such as water barrier ability, biodegradability, electrical behavior, mechanical characteristics are significant requisites for greater biocompatibility between the transient devices and organs, tissue and nerves. To reduce biological discrepancies between devices and the human body, researchers use FDA-approved polymers and metals present in the body (e.g., magnesium; Mg, and molybdenum; Mo). One challenge of transient electronics is difficulty controlling the degradation rate since each material has different degrees of biodegradability depending on the solvent experiments. For example, b-DCPU is fully dissolved in PBS (pH 7.4) at 90 °C after 90 days, whereas Mg maintains its shape for 25 days in PBS (pH 7.4) at 37 °C.
