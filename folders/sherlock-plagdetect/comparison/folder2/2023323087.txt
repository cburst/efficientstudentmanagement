Material science can make a better future because we live in the technology world and we need to develop better materials than before for technological advancement. During my university, I took a chance to enter a lab of a research institute experiment. I have never had such an experience before. It was so fresh and the communication came together to discuss one field. So, I became attracted to this field because I wanted to be a part of it. I am now researching Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDCs) in 2D Materials. It has one layer of atomic crystalline like graphene. Graphene has advantages in terms of various optical and physical properties, but it has a disadvantage that it cannot control the flow of electrons because there is no bandgap. One of the groups of materials that can make up for these shortcomings is TMCDs. However, the oxidation of the material continues, and the performance of the material is not properly expressed. It is very important to prevent the oxidation of the material because problems may occur in terms of corrosion or physical stability when the material is oxidized and the device may be damaged. So, we need to find ways to effectively protect against oxidation. Materials science encompasses the study of the physical and chemical properties inherent in various materials, thereby advancing knowledge of their structure, such as atomic arrangement and cellular structure. Additionally, researchers can tweak or change the machines for better benefit. When secondary batteries were first developed in 1859, scientists used ‘lead (Pb)’. However, because it was very large, it could not be used in small home appliances. Then, in 1980, today's lithium secondary battery was developed and succeeded in miniaturizing and lightweighting the battery (Jung-Ki Park, 2012). Graphene, one of the two-dimensional materials, shows high performance in various optical and physical properties, but because graphene has a zero bandgap, the flow of electrons cannot be controlled. A zero bandgap can cause equipment failure, so electron flow control is required. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are one of the candidates for handling electron flow. TMDC varies depending on the material, but since each material has a band gap, each material can effectively compensate for the shortcomings of graphene. In essence, materials science explores 'materials' to improve problems such as miniaturization of batteries and achieve better performance than before, such as the evolution from manganese batteries to alkaline batteries (Jung-Ki Park, 2012).    In 2012, the successful exfoliation of graphene from graphite sparked interest in two-dimensional materials among researchers [1]. Two-dimensional materials, consisting of numerous nanometer-thick atomic layers exhibit numerous advantageous characteristics such as thinness, flexibility, and enhanced strength. Consequently, researchers have explored their potential applications in semiconductors, batteries, displays, and other fields. Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDCs), a type of two-dimensional material, exhibit a specific band gap range; for instance, TiS2 has a band gap ranging from 0.05 to 2.5 eV [2], making them suitable for use in field-effect transistors (FETs) [3]. TMDCs offer the ability to control electron flow, thereby regulating the current passing between two terminals.  Q1. To what extent can the band gap of TMDCs be controlled?  One method of adjusting the band gap of TMDCs involves utilizing exfoliation techniques, such as solvent-based methods like Butyl Li transition, which can alter and potentially increase the band gap.          TMDC comprises a transition metal (M) and a chalcogen atom (X). Bulk TMDCs have a structure of multiple X-M-X layers, while single-layer TMDCs have a structure of a single X-M-X layer [1]. transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) offer versatile methods for tuning bandgaps. TMDCs exhibit a larger bandgap than the bulk state in their monolayer form. Therefore, controlling the bandgap in TMDCs is closely linked to the thickness of the material layer. One primary method for achieving monolayer structures is exfoliation, which involves separating layers of bulk TMDCs to obtain monolayers. Once a monolayer is obtained through exfoliation, it can demonstrate superior performance as a thin film for electronic devices. Monolayer TMDCs are produced by exfoliating bulk TMDCs containing multiple stacked layers, typically facilitated by techniques such as ultrasonic treatment in a solvent for extended periods, liquid exfoliation using milling-induced friction and collision, or mechanical methods including the use of Scotch tape [2]. Chemical methods also play a crucial role in obtaining monolayer TMDCs [3], where a chemical solution modifies the molecular structure to weaken the attractive force between sheets.         TMDCs exhibit semiconductor properties, making them suitable for various applications such as batteries, sensors, and displays due to their ability to control electric signals. For instance, micronized TMDCs produced through milling have been utilized as active materials in lithium electrodes for lithium batteries [5]. Additionally, exfoliated TMDCs have shown promise in transparent solar cell fabrication because of their light absorption properties within the visible spectrum [6].  TMDCs have received great attention in next-generation electronics and optoelectronics over the past few decades due to their unique properties and potential. Layered TMDCs, generally represented by the chemical formula MX2, are composed of transition metal elements (M) and chalcogen elements (X=S, Se, Te). In particular, in the bulk form, X-M-X layers are stacked, and adjacent layers are connected by interlayer van der Waals forces [1]. TMDCs with high crystallinity have more stable and consistent electrical properties and higher structural stability, thus providing higher reliability (RQ1.). Therefore, it is important to confirm the crystallinity of the material. To address the question RQ2, X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis is performed, and methods such as Raman spectroscopy can be used. Figure 1 shows the XRD of TiS2, one of the TMDCs materials, demonstrating that the peak arrangement has grown in the (001) direction, indicating that the crystal structure of the material is consistently aligned. Figure 2 shows the Raman spectrum of TiS2, where Raman activity peaks such as A1g and E1g, typical for layered materials, appear, indicating that a layered material with good crystallinity was synthesized [2, 3].   Numerous challenges arise in the preparation of exfoliated transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) for practical industrial applications e.g., batteries, sensors, and displays). TMDCs possess a layered structure with strong bonding within each plane, while bonds between layers are governed by weak van der Waals forces, facilitating their separation. Moreover, the physical properties of TMDCs ...., such as TMDCs have a band gap of 1-3 eV and can be varied depending on the number of layers that can be controlled making them promising materials for electronic devices [1]. The band gap size can be adjusted by manipulating the number of layers, mechanical [2] and chemical methods [3], have been employed to obtain monolayers of TMDCs each with its own set of challenges. Mechanical exfoliation, for instance, involves using Scotch tape to exfoliate layers. While this method exploits weak interlayer bonding this mechanical exfoliation is also limited; exfoliation can be applied to only certain areas, so its practical application is limited. Chemical exfoliation, on the other hand, relies on chemical solutions to modify the molecular structure and weaken interlayer attractions. Lithium is commonly used in this method, with lithium cations inserted between layers to facilitate exfoliation. However, stability issues and the risk of irregular bond destruction, coupled with the cost and explosive nature of lithium, pose significant challenges. To address the limitations of existing methods, recent studies have explored electrochemical exfoliation [3], which offers a relatively shorter and simpler process compared to other techniques. Finding optimal conditions for achieving thin layers at low voltages is crucial in this context. Additionally, it is important to find conditions in which thin layers can be obtained even at relatively low voltages.    References: [1]S. Ahmad and S.
