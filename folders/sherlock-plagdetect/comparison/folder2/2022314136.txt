A smart farm system is a system that uses various information and communication technologies (ICT) to measure weather, temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration to help crops grow well [1]. Elements that require adjustment are controlled and managed based on measured results. The target smart farm system in the study consists of five heat pumps, two water storage tanks, 25 fan coil units, a CO2 supplier, solar power generation, and smart farm itself.   However, using renewable energy sources like solar or wind power has the problem that energy is produced intermittently from nature [2]. That means that the electricity needed for smart farms will be unstable. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the amount of electricity produced according to the season and temperature. Additionally, it is important to predict the amount of electricity required by the smart farm depending on the season and the degree of Celsius.  In order to provide a stable supply of electricity, it is necessary to model the energy system. Through modeling, it is possible to predict the amount of power consumption according to the outside temperature and determine the amount of electricity that is insufficient depending on the weather. In addition, a life cycle assessment (LCA) must be conducted to determine whether using solar power generation instead of central power can reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and an economic feasibility evaluation under the same conditions is necessary. Smart farms integrated with renewable energy (e.g., solar energy), require a significant amount of electricity to maintain the interior temperature whenever the seasons and ambient temperature change. Maintaining the appropriate interior temperature of smart farms is a crucial factor in growing crops such as paprikas or tomatoes in the target smart farm. However, electricity production via renewable energy can be intermittent, so supplying electricity to smart farms may be unstable. At sunrise, electricity production from renewable sources increases. In contrast, there is no electricity production after sunset and at night [1]. Therefore, excess electricity produced during the daytime can be stored in a device such as ESS (Energy storage system), and ESS or the use of other heat supply devices such as wood pellet boilers or absorption chillers can be used to supply insufficient electricity at night [2].  Utilizing renewable energy is intended to reduce CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions generated by other heat supply devices. However, CO2 emissions may increase when other devices are used to provide a stable electricity supply. As a result, it is necessary to evaluate carbon emissions when using additional devices. For example, emissions may be generated during the process of tree cutting and transportation, even though wood pellets are carbon-neutral fuels. That’s because wood pellet production is low in Korea, so most wood pellets are imported [3]. Additionally, for the long-term operation of smart farms, investment and operating costs for heat supply devices must be considered. It is essential to comprehensively evaluate which operating scenario is more economically feasible and emits less CO2. For instance, When electricity production from solar power generation is insufficient, electricity is supplemented through the central power grid. The central power grid produces electricity from power plants using fossil fuels, so it emits a lot of CO2. In contrast, the use of photovoltaic and wood pellet boilers produces less emissions. Unfortunately, there are significant costs associated with solar panel installation and the purchase of boilers in the early stages of operation [4]. Therefore, it is essential to conduct research to compare which operation is effective by optimizing the balance between environmental and economic factors. Smart farm energy systems that integrate renewable energy sources need continuous heating and cooling. Building on the problems with independent energy supply with renewable energy from smart farm energy management, researchers are exploring and analyzing stable energy supply solutions to address similar challenges. For example, Karim Rabea et al. [1] analyzed solar power generation and estimated the required power consumption using the Matrix Laboratory program (MATLAB). In addition, C. A. Nallolla et al. [2] evaluated the feasibility of a solar photovoltaics (PV) microgrid system for a Baghdad household, using Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER) software and various control strategies. This study revealed that grid battery charging minimizes cost, while excluding it maximizes sustainability, and thus the potential for continuous and clean electricity in blackout areas is highlighted. In this way, research on energy supply to energy systems emphasizes renewable energy for heat sources in energy systems. However, independent energy supply through renewable energy solely is still impossible, so supplemental electricity must be supplied through central power grids [3]. Central Electric Power produces electricity through coal-fired power plants. For example, when using coal mined in Poland, 439.9 kgCO2 equivalent is emitted per 1kg, which shows that a larger amount of carbon dioxide is emitted than when using solar power generation [4]. Therefore, to reduce the amount of emissions, additional solar panels must be installed or additional systems that emit relatively low carbon dioxide, such as absorption refrigerators or wood pellet boilers, must be used [5]. Additionally, the initial investment cost and operating cost are required when smart farm systems utilize an additional system for long-term operation. Consequently, while the environmental benefits of adopting such systems are clear, it's equally important to consider the financial aspects. Instead of additionally utilizing central power in energy systems that integrate renewable energy sources, it is necessary to propose new operating scenarios for the use of additional systems. In addition, we believe that the optimal operation scenario can be selected by comparing carbon dioxide emissions and evaluating economic feasibility when using additional systems.  Numerous researchers have considered predictions of the electricity required by smart farms in order to ensure the stability of electrical supply [1-2]. Despite increasingly accurate energy system modeling, achieving complete energy independence solely through renewable energy resources remains challenging. For example, energy consumption during winter is very high due to the use of boilers for heating, but energy production through photovoltaic generation is less than energy consumption due to the influence of weather and seasons. Generally, photovoltaic generation is active when the sun rises. In contrast, there is no power generation at night [3]. Therefore, additional systems should be utilized to ensure sufficient energy supply for smart farms.  One option of an alternative system is to simply use centralized power to supply energy. For example, utilization of coal-fired power plants was selected without existing emissions restrictions. For reducing carbon dioxide emissions, renewable energy, air source heat pumps, and carbon-neutral heat source systems (e.g., wood pellet boilers, absorption chillers) help produce electricity. When using these alternative heat supply systems, it must be quantitatively assessed how much less or no carbon dioxide is generated compared to using central electricity. 439.9 kg CO2 equivalent is released per kg when coal mined in Poland is used [4], demonstrating the accuracy with which carbon dioxide emissions can be identified. Additionally, the initial investment cost and operating cost are required when smart farm systems utilize an additional system for long-term operation. Consequently, while the environmental benefits of adopting such systems are clear, this research project will equally consider the financial aspects.  RQ1. To what extent do solar panels, coal, and lithium bromide absorbent emit carbon dioxide between the time of production, transportation, and disposal? RQ2. What additional systems can be applied instead of central power to produce cooling in the summer and heating in the winter, and how can they be utilized in each season? RQ3. Which operational scenarios (e.g. a combination of photovoltaics generation and central power grid, a combination of photovoltaics and absorption chiller) are economically feasible in terms of investment cost, operating cost, and payback period for smart farms over a 20-year period? RQ4. To what extent can be saved in carbon tax charges or carbon dioxide purchase costs to grow crops by applying the improvement scenario?   In this way, this research project aims to evaluate the optimal operational scenario of smart farms by evaluating environmental impacts and economic factors. Some studies have analyzed renewable energy types [5] and regional energy consumption [6]. Accordingly, in this study, if we quantify emissions and determine whether it is economical according to various scenarios of smart farms, we will be able to establish an independent energy production/consumption operation method that allows long-term operation.  Achieving complete energy independence solely through renewable energy resources remains challenging. Researchers have explored predictions concerning the electricity required by smart farms in order to ensure a stable electrical supply [1]. For example, the total annual electricity consumption by the farm is measured at 367.16 MWh [2]. To address this, solar panels provide 234.12 MWh during real-time operation, while the remaining 133.04 MWh is covered by the fossil fuel-based central grid [2]. Instead of supplying insufficient electricity through the fossil fuel-based central grid, other systems should be considered (e.g., wood pellet boilers, additional installation of photovoltaics) to reduce emissions. G. Russo et al. [3] conducted a comparison between photovoltaic (PV)-ground heat pumps (GHP) and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG)-GHP to assess the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions using life cycle assessment (LCA) according to ISO 14040 [4]. Specifically, it is important to note that the use of GHP is not facilitated by central power grids. For Russo’s comparison, LCA analysis was carried out based on the examination of  the energy and materials used and wastes released to the environment throughout its lifecycle. It aims to identify ways to reduce a product's environmental footprint, guiding more sustainable decisions in product development and policy making. In addition, in assessing the economic feasibility of systems for energy supply, researchers compare the initial investment cost, operating cost, and net present value (NPV) for long-term operation [5-6]. For solar panels, the initial investment cost is indicated based on the system size rating of the panel. In F. Mansouri Kouhestani et al. [5], an investment cost of 2200$/kW is required for panels larger than 50kW and 2640$/kW for panels smaller than 5kW. Based on Kouhestani’s data analysis, it is possible to compare the minimum amount of solar power generation for NPV to 0, depending on the system capital cost. NPV of 0 means the point at which actual net profit can be generated considering cost values. In this way, the evaluation of the environmental and economic feasibility of the systems in energy-independent smart farms can lead to a basis for reasonable and optimized operation methods.   Answers to the above research questions require information on the components used in the production, transportation, and disposal of solar panels, coal, refrigerant for heat pumps and lithium bromide for absorption chillers. Thus, the input and output data of each process were entered into the SimaPro program [1] to derive the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) per functional unit (FU) of the four system elements, in an effort to answer RQ1.  For example, a solar panel results in 20 kg CO2 equivalent/1kW FU, which is equivalent to 50 kg CO2 emissions per year. Additionally, the result for carbon emissions resulting from mining to burning coal is 62 kg CO2/1 kg, resulting in 102 kg CO2 emissions per year. These results show that central power grids using coal produce higher CO2 emissions than those supplied by solar power generation [2,3]. Based on these insights, smart farm operation scenarios were suggested using the calculated CO2 emissions for solving RQ2. Instead of supplying insufficient electricity through the central power grid, operating with a combination of solar power generation, heat pumps, a wood pellet boiler, and an absorption chiller during the summer enabled reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by about 81%. Especially in winter, CO2 emissions were reduced by 78% by operating with a combination of solar power generation, heat pumps, and wood pellet boilers, because a large amount of electricity was supplied through the central power grid.         Considering the RQ3-4, despite the high initial investment cost of solar power generation, the operating cost of the central power grid using fossil fuels was about 1.5 times higher. For instance, the high transportation costs of imported coal and the additional electricity required due to significant losses during transfer from power plants to smart farms justify the economic advantage of using solar power, heat pumps, and wood pellet boilers. Additionally, the carbon dioxide purchase cost could be reduced through the small amount of carbon dioxide generated from the wood pellet boiler [4,5].         When conducting a life cycle assessment, there are differences in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions depending on the origin of the variables to be analyzed. For example, the CO2 emissions of coal mined in Poland and coal mined in China may be calculated differently depending on several variables, such as the manpower used in the mine, transportation methods, and equipment used. Specifically, coal mined in Poland [1] was 440 kg CO2 equivalent/functional unit (kg CO2 eq./FU), and coal mined in China [2] was 499 kg CO2 eq./FU. Therefore, these results show that there may be differences in the amount of CO2 depending on the production method and transportation distance of the energy sources used in smart farms. If you want to quantitatively compare the possibility of independent energy supply, comparing energy system operation scenarios with the different sources and production locations of energy sources is crucial.         Additionally, in the economic feasibility analysis, since carbon credit prices vary depending on countries, economic feasibility may not be improved even if emissions are reduced by using solar power generation instead of using the central power grid. Taking Korea as an example, the price of carbon credit was about $20 just 5 years ago, but currently, it is about $6 [3]. This is due to the “credits carryover strategy,” which is a system that allows some of the credits used this year to be carried over to the following year [4]. The strategy reduces the demand for companies to buy carbon credits and increases the number of credits in the current year, causing the price of carbon credits to fall. Thus, the function of carbon credit prices is not working properly. Due to these economic phenomena, a lot of energy systems may choose to purchase carbon credits rather than add facilities to reduce carbon dioxide emissions [5]. Compared with this phenomenon, in this study, the installation of solar panels, wood pellet boilers, etc. for independent energy supply might be more expensive. Therefore, to alleviate this problem, analysis of smart farm operation scenarios according to the amount of emission permits can lead to a positive direction by maintaining a balance between carbon credit prices and costs of greenhouse gas reduction facilities in future works.
