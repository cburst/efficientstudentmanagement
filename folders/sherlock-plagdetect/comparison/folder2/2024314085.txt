Renewable energy resources (RESs) such as wind power, photovoltaic generation, and energy storage systems constitute state-of-the-art techniques to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Many countries are installing RESs while simultaneously replacing conventional synchronous generators (SGs), which utilize coal and gas to RESs. Unlike SGs, RESs don’t have rotating masses and cannot provide inertia response. Additionally, predicting the output of RESs is challenging due to the uncertainty associated with weather forecasts. As a result, when the strength of the power system associated with the system inertia becomes weak, system operators cannot struggle to maintain its reliability. For example, if there is a problem with reliability, the power system can experience blackouts, and the operator should monitor unpredicted power flows, such as power oscillation and resonance. My research focuses on investigating power oscillation employing small-signal stability analysis (SSSA) based on Taylor series expansion around the operating point, called linearization of the power system. SSSA is a powerful analysis method used in power system analysis to identify system instability by examining the eigenvalues obtained from linearizing the system equations around an operating point. However, the term ‘small’ in SSSA is often considered ambiguous, as it refers to perturbations or deviations from the operating point, which may vary depending on the context or interpretation. In general, events like generator trips, line faults, and power curtailments represent ‘large’ signals, while activities like parameter tuning and steady-state operation involve ‘small’ signals [1]. Power system engineers encounter challenges in accurately quantifying the range within which linearization remains valid due to the dependence of the system response on the magnitude of disturbances [2-3]. Additionally, the power system’s intrinsic nonlinear and time-varying properties further complicate this assessment. To facilitate SSSA, I'm studying power system stability using linear algebra to analyze the system’s behavior through a matrix-based approach. As discussed previously, the increasing integration of renewable energy resources (RESs) into power systems poses challenges to their stability. Factors such as load variations, fluctuations in RESs’ power outputs, and controller parameter tuning can alter operating points obtained from power flow equations. Although these events may not destabilize robust grids, RESs-installed power systems may encounter stability issues. Conventionally, the lack of negative damping torque, improper parameter tuning, and positive real part of eigenvalues lead to small-signal instability [1]. However, events not addressed by conventional small-signal stability analysis (SSSA) research areas occur, and system operators report stability issues after the event. I propose two novel methods to deal with SSSA. First, I will estimate the frequency nadir of power systems using perturbation theory. Under- or over-frequency is a crucial metric of whether power systems withstand their instability, so phasor measurement units (PMUs) are used to estimate the frequency nadir [2-3]. However, PMUs are not sufficiently installed in power systems, and additional data preprocessing is needed because PMU data include noise signals [4]. If the size of the event is small, solving SSSA using perturbation theory is possible because it only requires calculating the power flow equation to obtain the current operating point. Therefore, I propose a new bifurcation that clarifies the small and large signal criteria based on the first proposed method. Specifying bifurcation in SSSA using perturbation theory helps operators to decide on appropriate operation unless the size of the system matrix changes, i.e., large-signal stability. Employing these methods, system operators can anticipate and address power system events before frequency reaches critical levels.            The high penetration of renewable energy resources (RESs) holds promise for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. However, intermittent power generation poses challenges to power system reliability. Grid-Forming (GFM) inverters, which can increase reliability [1], have been proposed to mimic conventional synchronous generators. Since GFM inverters generate the reserve power, they can be modeled as virtual synchronous generators (VSMs), allowing for the analysis of various scenarios with high penetration of RESs in terms of inertia and damping ratio [2]. While GFM inverters have not yet been demonstrated in real power systems, system operators are considering energy storage systems (ESSs), which are already installed in real power systems. The ramp rate limit indicates a linear increment of power output, state of charge (SOC) implies the charging amount, and state of health (SOH) refers to the lifetime. They are key parameters when for ESS stability maintenance. However, if ESSs contain ideal DC voltage sources, real-time simulations cannot consider dynamic responses (e.g., ramp rate limit). Since ESSs have a slow ramp rate limit property, a high ramp rate limit is crucial for providing a fast inertia response [3]. SOH concerns aging in ESSs, such that an imbalance in SOH causes a change in the internal resistance and output voltage of ESSs. Eigenvalue analysis is a powerful tool for determining SOH and SOC. After eigenvalue analysis under resistive and constant power load conditions, SOC and SOH balancing were demonstrated in a microgrid using a hardware-in-loop (HIL) test [4]. Although ESSs increase the stability of power systems, unpredictable oscillations can occur in ESSs, which can worsen the stability of power systems. To address unpredictable oscillation, the dynamic grid flexibility (DGF) (i.e., inertia and flexibility index) is calculated using numerical-based matrix perturbation theory, where perturbations of interest are only due to the active power injection in each bus. The difference in the condition number for the most critical eigenvalue between the perturbed and original system indicates the sensitivity of the damping, and therefore, the system stability will improve when the discrepancy increases [5]. However, studies in [5] considered only one eigenvalue; eigenvalues exist as much as the size of the system matrix. All eigenvalues and eigenvectors influence DFG, so I am verifying these factors as I verify my equations. These equations will estimate the power system frequency nadir, and system operators will receive the estimated value and maintain the dynamic stability whenever perturbations occur.   The increasing integration of renewable energy resources (RESs) into power systems has raised concerns about power system stability [1]. While RESs offer potential benefits for reducing carbon dioxide emissions, their intermittent power generation poses challenges for maintaining system reliability. Specifically, as determined by factors such as multi-machine swing equations [2], the balance between load demand and power generation plays a crucial role in maintaining frequency stability, which is reported in practical power systems; according to the Korea Power Exchange, overgeneration from RESs, as observed in Jeju Island, have necessitated power curtailments by system operators, with 181 such instances recorded in 2023 [3]. Historically, frequency stability analysis has been categorized into large-signal and small-signal analysis (SSSA) [4]. Large-signal stability analysis addresses events like generator trips and line faults in power systems, while SSSA focuses on negative damping ratios using eigenvalue analysis in synchronous generators (SGs) [5]. Although conventional SG-based power systems are sufficiently robust to withstand nominal frequency because of their rotating mass, RES-based modern power systems lack inertia, potentially leading to negative damping effects. ENTSO-E has documented reports of unpredictable oscillations of power systems occurring shortly after generator trips [6]. Therefore, this paper aims to address the following research questions:  RQ 1. To what extent can small-signal stability analysis interpret large-signal stability events (e.g., generator trips and line faults) in power systems? RQ 2. To what extent can small-signal stability analysis provide feasible stability criteria, such as a bifurcation between small-signal and large-signal in power systems?  In this way, this paper proposes a new methodology to interpret power system stability using SSSA and addresses the stability bifurcation between small-signal and large-signal conditions through numerical analysis.    To address the feasible region for small-signal stability analysis (SSSA) in practical power systems, this paper proposes a novel method to estimate the frequency nadir (FN) and transient response in time-domain simulations. The region where the FN estimation holds within the SSSA boundary will be used to establish eigenvalue analysis-based stability criteria. In power system SSSA, non-linear time-variant systems are linearized around steady-state operating points to model them as linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. This linearization allows for the analysis of small disturbances using eigenvalue analysis in the matrix form as follows:  (1) Equation (1) represents the linearized system of equations derived from the power system model. Solving the linear eigenvalue problem (LEP) generated from this system provides eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which can take time-domain state variable solutions combined with several first-order modal interactions. Consider the kth state variable that can be derived from (1):         (2) Equation (2) describes the state variable solutions derived from the linearized system, indicating that various modes are simultaneously excited during system disturbances. However, the extent of excitation for modes will be different. The example is described using the participation factor (PF) introduced in [1-2] as follows: if the speed of generator G10 decreases via unexpected additional torque, modes that contain a relatively large PF related to G10 will be dominant, yet other modes should be considered as modal interactions as discussed in (2). This paper assumes that all modes are equally excited to mimic excitations of modal interactions in the transient response. However, this assumption does not accurately reflect practical scenarios like inquiries related to the transient response for a practical grid event within the feasible SSSA boundary. In matrix perturbation theory [3], eigenvalues and eigenvectors are perturbed, and variations in state variables are time-variant, though systems are LTI systems. In addition, similarity transformation with a matrix of right eigenvectors cannot guarantee the existence of an inverse matrix when the system is perturbed. Thus, the total differentials of time-domain solutions derived in (2) are required to analyze transient responses.         In order to investigate time-domain responses within load events, this paper assumes that the total differentials are approximately equal to total increments. The modification allows to establish the following time-step results for state variables. Therefore, the modification of total differentials to analyze increments in the time-domain is as follows: (3) Afterward, the estimated transient responses can be established by updating the result for state variables using differences as follows: (4) The Jacobian matrix’s diagonal element difference between the pre- and post-perturbed systems determines the sign of gamma. If diagonal elements related to generator speeds decrease, the sign should be positive; otherwise, it is negative. In this study involving the IEEE 39-bus system, a stepwise increase in active power for Load25 is considered to evaluate the proposed method. The time-domain responses obtained from simulation and estimation are compared in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Time-domain responses for simulation (blue) and estimation with proposed method (red).  Figure 1 shows that the estimation of the G10 speed closely follows the simulation results, with a small error in FN of 0.00756 Hz. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method for estimating transient responses in SSSA within practical power systems.   Answers to the aforementioned questions require simulations of the IEEE 39-bus system under stepwise increments in active power for loads connected near generators to evaluate the proposed method. The simulation and estimation results were obtained from DIgSILENT PowerFactory and MATLAB software, respectively. Fig. 1 illustrates the comparison of the time-domain generator G10 speed state variable responses obtained from simulation and estimation. According to Fig. 1, which shows that when the active power of Load 25 increases by 20% (i.e., 44.8 MW), the estimation of the G10 speed closely follows the simulation result, with a small error in frequency nadir (FN) of 0.00756 Hz. However, in the case of Load 04 active power increment with 20% (i.e., 100 MW), the error in FN is 0.0414 Hz, indicating that the event didn’t yield a feasible region for SSSA and the proposed matrix perturbation-based estimation scheme. RQ 1 allows for the comparison of these two events such that estimation can follow the simulation result for sufficiently small variations of active power for loads. Still, estimation cannot be done for large variations of active power for loads. Moreover, matrix perturbation theory assumes no variation in the matrix size, which does not cover events such as generator trips. Sudden line faults and clearing within one cycle may be interpreted using SSSA. If fault-clearing cycles increase, some eigenvalues may proceed to the right half plane, an unstable region in control engineering, and power systems can suffer from blackouts. Experiments addressing RQ 2 will be conducted in future works.   This letter proposed frequency nadir (FN) estimation using matrix perturbation theory. The proposed method calculates FN whenever pre-perturbed data obtained through power flow analysis from pre-perturbed systems are available to system operators. The matrix perturbation theory shows promise in allowing small-signal stability analysis (SSSA) to interpret practical transient responses in power systems by utilizing total differentials of SSSA-based state solutions. Note that eigenvector perturbations with eigenvalue degeneracy are derived from the biorthogonal property of right and left eigenvectors. However, the applicability of the proposed method is limited to non-defective power systems (i.e., eigenvectors can diagonalize systems). Additionally, the matrix size of systems must remain consistent between pre- and post-perturbed systems. Any changes in matrix size necessitate system operators to recalculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors for applying matrix perturbation theory. As discussed earlier, the performance of FN estimation is determined by pre-defined parameters. This letter suggests a method for parameter selection, although the values may vary across different power systems. Future research endeavors will focus on formulating matrix perturbation theory for defective power systems (i.e., eigenvectors cannot diagonalize systems) and addressing parameter selection in practical power systems, synch as the power systems in South Korea, where renewable energy resources (RESs) are integrated.
