Fuel cell technology is gaining more attention in terms of efficiency and environment friendliness. Fuel cell technology doesn’t make any carbon dioxide since the reacting gas is only hydrogen and oxygen. Also, efficiency of fuel cells is relatively higher (70%) than other technologies like combustion engines (30%). I chose to work and conduct research in this field because I believe that fuel cell technology is the most powerful method to deal with climate change. Although there are many advantages of fuel cell technology, several challenges are still present. One of the challenges is the price. To operate the fuel cell, experimental setup which include interconnect, cell, manifold, endplate is needed. Given recent global temperature anomalies and increasing CO2 emissions, CO2 emissions may be responsible for global temperature anomalies. As global temperatures increase, serious disasters like extreme weather or sea level rise can damage the world. Therefore, decreasing the amount of CO2 emissions is one of the ways to resolve global warming. To reduce the amount of CO2 emissions, Solid Oxide Fuel Cells(SOFCs) have been proposed as a promising technology for clean power production, in particular, distributed power generation sources. The reason why SOFCs can produce clean power is that the reacting gas of SOFCs contains only hydrogen and oxygen. Thus, SOFCs do not emit any COx, NOx, and SOx which are the combustion products of fossil fuels. However, SOFCs have challenges related to the reaction distribution. SOFCs consume hydrogen and oxygen when they electrochemically react within the cell, but as the reacting gas flows along the channel, the mole fraction of hydrogen and oxygen decreases. Maldistribution of the hydrogen and oxygen can cause chemical stresses to cells and aggravate the degradation rates of SOFCs operation. Therefore, the goal of my research is to supply the reacting gas uniformly at channel level and stack level of SOFCs. Researchers in the field of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) heavily researched electrochemical cells in SOFCs. Researchers have focused on post-mortem analysis of cells after SOFC operations, due to the impossibility of visually observing the cells surrounded by multiple sheets of steel in an opaque hot furnace during SOFC operations. To compensate for the difficulties of visual observation, studies using commercial simulation packages, such as ANSYS or COMSOL have been initiated to elucidate the electrochemical environment of the cell when the SOFCs are in operation (Padullés, 2000). Early studies using simulation tools were often conducted at small scales, far from commercial stacks, to investigate the internal physics of SOFCs, and mesh size reduction to reduce computational costs led to significant errors between simulation results and actual experiments (Xue, 2005). Due to advances in numerical analysis techniques, optimization of commercial simulation packages, and reduction in computational processing time, more advanced models are under development, allowing computational analysis studies at the short-stack level of SOFCs (AI-Masri, 2014) and in the future at the commercial-scale level of SOFCs (Kim, 2020).

Researchers in the field of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) have studied their internal physics (Kim, 2020), such as the mole fraction of reacting gases (e.g., hydrogen, oxygen) average temperature of SOFC stacks, and the current density of each cell to investigate the relationship between SOFCs’ internal physics and the degradation rates (=(operating voltage - open circuit voltage)/(open circuit voltage)*100) of SOFC operations. However, difficulties in measuring the inside of SOFCs due to the high operating temperature of SOFCs, and hermetic sealing between their components (e.g., interconnect, manifold, cell frame) within SOFC stacks, 3D simulation tools such as ANSYS or COMSOL can reveal SOFCs’ internal phenomena. Therefore, this research project will focus on parametric studies of the mole fraction of reacting gases, the average temperature of SOFC stacks, and the current density of each cell to ascertain the main parameter which aggravates the degradation rates of SOFC stacks.  RQ1. To what extent does the mole fraction of hydrogen change the degradation rates of SOFC stacks? RQ2. To what extent does the mole fraction of oxygen change the degradation rates of SOFC stacks? RQ3. To what extent does the average temperature of SOFC stacks change degradation rates of SOFC stacks? RQ4. To what extent does the current density of each cell change the degradation rates of SOFC stacks?          Based on these four research questions, this research project will analyze the sensitivity of SOFCs’ degradation rates across four key parameters. Based on the results of sensitivity analysis, this research may suggest the operation guide (e.g., the optimal temperature for stack operation, the minimum mole fraction of hydrogen in the cell, and the maximum standard deviation of current density in the cell) for SOFC stacks.                     To address these four research questions, both SOFC stack experiments and 3D multi-physics numerical simulations using commercial engineering tools (e.g., ANSYS or COMSOL) are necessary. SOFC stack experiments are necessary because measuring the degradation rates of SOFCs is not possible with conventional engineering tools, since we cannot consider the random change of cells’ microstructures in numerical simulations. Therefore, SOFC stack experiments are the only way to derive the degradation rates of SOFC stacks. Then, how can correlation of the 3D numerical simulations with SOFC stack experiments be achieved? If 3D numerical models of SOFC stacks are well-aligned with real stack experiments, simulation results can facilitate estimation of internal environments (e.g., the mole fraction of gases, the average temperature of stacks, the current density of cells) via real stack experiments.  Alignment here refers to applying actual physical phenomena to numerical simulations as accurately as possible. All of these simulation conditions below should be aligned with real stack experiments. Five governing equations (i.e., mass conservation, species conservation, energy conservation, momentum conservation, charge conservation)  Boundary conditions (e.g., the mole ratio of hydrogen and steam at the fuel inlet, the mole ratio of oxygen and nitrogen at the air inlet, inlet temperature of fuel and air, and operating current density of cells, etc.) Constitutive equations (e.g., binary diffusion at channel and manifold, knudsen diffusion in porous media, electronic conductivity of electron conductor, ionic conductivity of ceramic, etc.)         To address the four research questions above, SOFC stack experiments and results of 3D numerical simulations using engineering tools like ANSYS or COMSOL are necessary. Considering RQ1-4, degradation rate (=(operating voltage-open circuit voltage)/open circuit voltage*100), which can be obtained from the SOFC stack experiments, is the main parameter for comparing the simulation results (i.e., the mole fraction of hydrogen, the mole fraction of oxygen, the average temperature of SOFC stacks, and the current density of each cell). In terms of RQ1, if the minimum value of the hydrogen mole fraction becomes lower, the degradation rates of SOFC stacks will increase rapidly. This increase occurs because hydrogen is an essential component to make electrochemical reactions available. As in RQ1, if the minimum value of the oxygen mole fraction becomes lower, the degradation rates of SOFC stacks will not maintain target performance levels (e.g., less than 1.2% degradation rate per kilo-hour operation), since oxygen is also a major component for electrochemical reactions (e.g., reaction of hydrogen and oxygen makes water and electricity). Similarly, RQ3-4 is closely related with RQ1-2, because the mole fraction of hydrogen and oxygen determines the distribution of electrochemical reactions, which results in average temperature for SOFC stacks and the current density of each cell. If the spatial distribution of hydrogen and oxygen is uniform within SOFC cells, the current density of each cell will likewise be uniformly distributed. As in other engineering research fields, one of the challenges of producing Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) is commercialization, given substantial maintenance costs. Generally, the composition of SOFC stacks can be divided into metal parts (i.e., bipolar plates, current collecting layers, and manifolds) and ceramic parts (i.e., sealants and electrochemical cells).  Metal parts require Computer Numerical Control (CNC) manufacturing processes, which can cost about $1,000 to make 1 bipolar plate, as metal parts need a flow path for reacting molecules like hydrogen and oxygen. Similarly, combinations of the current collecting layers’ composition (e.g., for the NiCo current collecting layer, Ni:Co = 9:1, Ni:Co = 8.5:1.5, Ni:Co = 8:2, etc.) should be optimized by deciding the weight percent of each component of the current collecting layer based on performance and durability. This optimization process is time-consuming, expensive, and challenging because the number of components’ combinations can be infinite.  Meanwhile, catalytic elements, which can reduce the activation of electrochemical reactions, are selected for durability and performance of electrochemical cells, but the process is also demanding. Although precious metals usually represent high performance and durability of cells, overusing precious metals must lead to higher manufacturing cost of cells, thus balancing the performance of cells and the cost of cells is critical. Then how about sealant? The sealant also needs the selection of components like current collecting layers and catalytic elements, which can result in high costs and require extensive research for the selection of sealant materials. On the other hand, in contrast to current collecting layers, sealant must ensure insulating properties for preventing short circuit of SOFC stacks, which can cause irreversible damages (e.g., high degradation rate of cells, and low open circuit voltage (same as permanent loss of electricity)) to the cells.
