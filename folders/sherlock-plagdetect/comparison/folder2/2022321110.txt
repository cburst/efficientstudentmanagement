  Economics is important for the whole society. Each city, region and country are an economic entity, and every economic entity has economic indicators such as GDP (Gross Domestic Product), CPI (Consumer Price Index) … These specialized vocabularies sound far away from individuals, but it is undoubtable that all of these indicators are closely connected to people’s daily life. These indicators show economic situations such as the changes in individuals' wages and the price level just in some numbers. To improve people's lives and make the country survive healthily, it is absolutely necessary to pay great attention to these economic indicators (Ahmed & Suliman, 2011). This is one of the reasons why economics is so important, but it’s not the reason why I chose Economics as my major at the beginning. I started studying Economics in college for a simple reason: this major was a good choice to match my college entrance examination score. After 4 years of study, I realized my interest in Economics and I decided to study further in Economics, especially development economics and econometrics. I hope that I can self-plan my own future better according to economic indicators and the current economic situation by studying Economics. If it is possible, I will use all the professional knowledge I have learned to contribute to the economy of my city and country to make all the people have a more stable and happier lives.    Economics research spans various disciplines, primarily macroeconomics, microeconomics and econometrics, each with numerous subfields. My research areas range from development economics to macroeconomics and the application of machine learning techniques derived from econometrics. Specifically, I explore causal relationships between online shopping behaviors like sales and purchasing patterns and macroeconomic indicators such as unemployment rates and price levels , employing specialized mathematical models. In the contemporary era of digital transformation, online shopping and e-commerce have proliferated. However, there remains a paucity of economic research in this new field. Utilizing mathematical models and machine learning to establish causality between online shopping dynamics and macroeconomic variables holds significance for both governmental policy formulation and corporate strategy development. Governments can leverage these insights to predict future economic trends and devise appropriate policies, while companies can assess market conditions and tailor their strategies accordingly. Furthermore, I analyzed both short-term and long-term impacts using a vector error correction model. This novel application of machine learning in real-world scenarios may inspire further exploration among scholars in the field.  The role of e-commerce in driving economic growth has been a subject of extensive research. Several studies illuminate the various impacts of e-commerce on economic dynamics and offer insights into different regions worldwide. For example, Evgeniya K. Karpunina et al. (2021) utilized correlation, covariance, and variance analysis to investigate e-commerce impacts in Russia, showing that the development of e-commerce significantly contributes to national economic growth. The contribution of e-commerce to economic growth had been particularly pronounced during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, Payel Chaudhuri and Abhishek Kumar (2015) showed the significance of e-commerce during global downturns. E-commerce, as a key economic driver, creates employment opportunities and contributes to Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Extending this exploration to a regional context, Zhu Fangyang and You Yong (2023) examined the mutual influence among Guangxi's foreign trade, modern logistics, and economic development. They used a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) to demonstrate the long-term relationship between these factors. While previous researchers have explored the economic impact of cross-border e-commerce on various economies, there is space for targeted studies regarding the interrelation between Korean cross-border e-commerce and Korean macroeconomic health, such that specifically, the interrelation between Korean cross-border e-commerce and macroeconomic health remains insufficiently explored. My research aims to address this gap by investigating the mutual impacts and providing valuable insights into how Korea's cross-border e-commerce contributes to the overall macroeconomic landscape. Although many researchers have investigated the relationship between traditional e-commerce and national economies, by considering economic growth and price levels [1-2], recent developments in cross-border e-commerce present new dynamics that may impact national economies differently and may have unexpected influence on national economies[3]. With the implementation of blockade policies and the promotion of globalization, residents of various countries are engaging in cross-border online shopping with increasing frequency [4]. This shift transcends the traditional geographical limitations of e-commerce, which may cause some abnormal economic fluctuation.The impacts of online purchasing and sales on national economic development, price levels, unemployment, and international payments balance vary considerably [5-6]. Therefore, this research project includes an in-depth study of the intricate correlation between online shopping activities and the macroeconomic landscape in Korea. It aims to explore both  the short-term and long-term dynamics of these two phenomena as well as their interaction.  RQ1. To what extent are online direct overseas sales and Korean macroeconomic health correlated? RQ2. To what extent are online direct overseas purchasing and Korean macroeconomic health correlated?  This correlational analysis aims to shed light on the significance of cross-border e-commerce in contemporary economies and provide several insights into the evolving digital economic landscape.   To begin answering these research questions, data collection must proceed. The level of e-commerce development is represented by online direct overseas sales and online direct overseas purchasing. Macroeconomic health is measured using four indicators: Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Consumer Price Index (CPI), unemployment rate, and Balance of International Payments (BOP). Regarding the specific model for this research project, since this macroeconomic study addresses a large amount of time series data,a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) should be employed in this study [1-2].  The following paragraphs are the specific method and model of the research. Firstly, the Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test is employed to assess the stationarity of the time series data. If any series is found to be non-stationary, data transformation such as taking logarithms or differences is conducted to achieve stationarity [3]. If the results show that one of the data series is non-stationary, then all data should be further processed [4]. Specifically, non-stationary data can be addressed by calculating the logarithm of the data or performing a differential operation. However, if stationarity cannot be achieved simultaneously after two differential operations, data analysis will be rendered meaningless, and the model should be terminated immediately. Secondly, a Johansen cointegration test is conducted to determine if there are correlated relationships between the data [5]. Since in the process of cointegration testing, the lag order of the model should be determined first, a Vector Autoregression (VAR) model is also necessary for determining the lag order [6]. Consider the following for the current sentence: If cointegration exists, a Granger causality test is performed to assess predictive relationships between variables. Initial determination of the independent variables and dependent variables and assess whether one variable can predict the future trend of another variable can proceed after implementing the Granger causality test. Thirdly, a VECM can be established for stationary time series with cointegration and causality based on the results of the Johansen cointegration test and the Granger causality test. The stability and validity of the model are verified through unit root and residual autocorrelation tests. Specifically, the explanation of this model should include whether each independent variable has a positive or negative, and a large or small impact on the dependent variable. Finally, The current sentence could be reorganized briefly: a pulse model is applied to examine significant changes over time in the established relationships, providing insights into long-term relationships between variables.  Following these steps, the interaction between online shopping and macroeconomic health can be appropriately inferred.    To obtain the results of above research questions,several preliminary tests on the data are necessary, including Augmented Dicke-Fuller (ADF) stationarity test, Johansen cointegration test, Granger causality test, and empirical analysis establishing the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). Following preliminary testing,if all time series data are stationary, there may be cointegration relationships and mutual predictive relationships among the variables. While existing literature predominantly focuses on data from countries such as Russia [1] and India [2], this research specifically targets data from South Korea. The results of the preliminary tests serve as the foundation for later empirical analysis, such that data stationary, cointegration relationship, causality relationship, etc. may be generally aligned with those reported in  existing literature. With the completion of the preliminary tests, variables can be selected, and VECMs can be established.   To address the two research questions, two separate VECMs (VECM 1 and VECM 2) first to be established. Following the preliminary testing, the dependent variable of VECM 1 may be online direct overseas sales, with independent variables may be Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Consumer Price Index (CPI), and Balance of Payment (BOP). GDP may exhibit a positive correlation with sales, while other variables show negative correlations. For Model 2, the dependent variable may be online direct overseas purchasing, with independent variables may be GDP, CPI, BOP, and the unemployment rate. GDP may be positively correlated with purchasing, while other variables may be negatively correlated. Although the direction of variable variation across various literature may be roughly similar, differences in data extraction and processing methods can lead to variations in the degrees of correlation among multiple variables even when the same methods are employed [3].   In the process of examining the correlated relationship between e-commerce and macroeconomic health, selecting variables to represent these two indicators is necessary. Specifically, online direct overseas sales and online direct overseas purchasing were chosen as proxies for the development level of cross-border e-commerce. However, relying solely on two variables may not accurately depict this indicator. To measure e-commerce indicators more precisely, additional data collection and analysis should be warranted, or the model should be further improved. For example, researchers should first establish multiple models to assess the foundation, scale, and potential of cross-border e-commerce development, followed by integrating these models to create comprehensive cross-border e-commerce measurement indicators, which would yield more accurate results. By leveraging more extensive datasets and refining more modeling approaches, a more precise representation of the development level of cross-border e-commerce can be achieved. Furthermore, despite the multi-decade evolution of cross-border e-commerce, the explosion of data collection and related research has mainly occurred in recent decades. Consequently, the relevant statistical data does not cover an optimal timeframe. This research project utilizes 10-year quarterly data, which may still be insufficient for robust modelling. The limited dataset may lead to significant but substantial data quality issues into the research findings. Therefore, in subsequent research, the model robustness analysis will be considered to an even greater extent. For instance, incorporating additional control variables to assess the stability of the models and results is essential. Alternatively, ongoing research efforts should include updated statistical data to avoid data quality issues and bolster the credibility of the findings.
