Semiconductors are at the core of modern technologies, bringing possibilities to all future technologies. From the earliest individual computer to the most famous technologies like space exploration and artificial intelligence today, across generations of technologies, semiconductors remain an indispensable foundation. To participate and commonly witness the progress of this era, and even contribute to it, is the thing I aspire to do and would make me proud of. Throughout, the major challenges of semiconductors are how to make components smaller and faster. However, it would be hard to make a big improvement by a single person. All we can do is keep trying different methods like changing different materials or architectures, accumulating experience for the progress of the future. In recent years, due to the advancement of AI technology, the data that needs to be processed has increased, and a faster processing speed is required. However, the old-generation memory can’t provide that computational power. People are seeking a better device and trying to fix this problem. Resistive Random-access Memory (RRAM) is one of the emerging memory, and it's attracting significant attention due to its low power consumption and high-speed performance. Additionally, RRAM's unique conduction mechanism, which can switch between high and low resistance states, enables it to directly apply as neurons in neural networks. The work I’m doing is modeling RRAM, trying to have a deeper understanding of the device mechanism, like the formation process of the filament which will be forming after applying the voltage at the electrode. Once the filament is formed, the device will transfer to a low resistance state, and what I am concerned about is the diffusion of the particles, the location of the filament, and the shape of the filament. I'll figure out this issue and try to control the filament to make the device more stable and extend its lifespan. Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM), an emerging memory, fundamentally consists of a three-layer structure as Metal-Insulator-Metal [1]. Common materials of electrodes include Ag, Al, Ti, and TiN, and some researchers are interested in 2D materials nowadays. Meanwhile, typical materials for the Insulator layer include HfO2, TiO2, SiO2, and Al2O3. There are two types of RRAM which are Conducting-Bridge Random-Access Memory (CBRAM) [2] and Oxide-based Resistive Random Access Memory (OxRAM) [3]. Different compositions of these materials will decide the type of the RRAM device. The difference between these two is the formation of filament [4]. Using Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) [5] for nanoscale modeling of the filament [6] can improve a deeper understanding of the formation by analyzing the location, shape, and size of the filament in the device. In recent years, with the rapid advancement of Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) [1] in the field of storage technologies, researchers have increasingly focused on the accuracy and practicality of RRAM modeling [2] [3] [4] . Particularly, with the new developments in material science and electronic engineering, the performance and reliability of RRAM have seen significant improvements, highlighting its potential in applications of non-volatile memory and logic operations [5] . Additionally, accurate RRAM models can effectively guide designers in optimizing device performance, achieving more efficient and lower power consumption electronic products [6] . Therefore, this research project will focus on the performance variations of RRAM devices under different working conditions, through precise modeling analysis of their resistive switching characteristics and endurance.  RQ1. To what extent does RRAM accelerate computational speed? RQ2. To what extent do the resistive switching characteristics of RRAM devices vary under different working conditions?  RQ3. To what extent do RRAM models accurately predict the formation and structure of conductive filaments? RQ4. To what extent can RRAM effectively simulate neurons in neuromorphic computing systems?  Through this research, the project will explore the effectiveness of RRAM modeling to predicting and optimizing in predicting and optimizing device performance, and assess its practical value in real-world apps. Although some studies have considered the accuracy and reliability of RRAM models, specific research on the current state of RRAM technology and modeling methods may help establish the potential value of these models in future and practical apps. The method of this research, we will develop a physical Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM) model using Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD). Understanding the conductivity characteristics of RRAM is essential for creating a model that accurately simulates its behavior in neural computing. [1] highlighted that the processes of electron and ion migration are the primary factors influencing this characteristic. Incorporating insights from [2], we will encompass molecular dynamics simulation into the TCAD model. To apply this model to simulate neural computing, we referred to the research of [3]. They utilized quantum dot tunneling structure simulation techniques to replicate the resistance changes of RRAM devices. This technique can simulate the activity regulation of neural synapses, including long-term potentiation and long-term depression processes. Through this method, the resistance modulation of RRAM devices is used to mimic the changes in neural synapses during the learning and memory processes, thereby achieving precise simulation of neural signal transmission behaviors. In measuring changes in computing speed using RRAM as a synapse, combining the device model and circuit model is necessary. Because of the special characteristics of RRAM, its random resistance can make it like a weight in the neural system. When voltage is applied and passes through an RRAM, the current value can be obtained. In an RRAM array, the total current value of each row is similar to the product of inputs and weights in a neural network. By using this method, we will introduce simple images or text recognition to test its accuracy and computation speed. Subsequently, the results can be compared with those of traditional memory.    The ideal outcome for RQ 1 and 4 is that RRAM can significantly accelerate the entire computational framework. The explicit acceleration efficiency will be determined by incorporating results from image and text recognition speed compared to other components. Typically, the estimated acceleration rate would be above 13%. Considering RQ 2, the connection between the 1, 0 signals in the RRAM simulated neurons and the high and low resistance states of the components can be clearly determined through the process of the experiment, which is how the resistance state controls the 1,0 signals. In terms of the RQ 3, since a microscopic physical model was employed in the experiment, this experiment anticipates highly precise results. Including the diffusion phenomenon of particles (ions, oxygen) at various voltage levels, as well as their formation/decomposition into filaments. It also encompasses predicting the structure, size, and position of the filaments. When establishing a Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) model, numerous challenges arise, particularly concerning the adjustment of a multitude of parameters. These parameters encompass material-related aspects and parameters associated with simulating filament formation and dissolution. Among the hurdles encountered, the sheer volume of parameters necessitating adjustment stands out prominently. These encompass material properties such as conductivity, electron barrier heights, and dielectric constants, alongside parameters governing filament formation and dissolution, such as electric field strength, temperature, and time. Adjusting these parameters demands copious experimental data and computational resources. Though referencing past studies allows for the definition of relevant parameters used in manufacturing RRAM, parameters related to filament pose the greatest challenges. Even for the entire research field, the exact conduction mechanism and associated principles of RRAM remain uncertain. Consequently, it is difficult to define and validate these parameters.
