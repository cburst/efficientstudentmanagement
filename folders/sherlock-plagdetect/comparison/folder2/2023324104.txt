From a young age I have always been fascinated by plants and their ability to grow from a seed the size of a dot into a tree bigger than my own house. Through the process of my bachelor’s I came to appreciate the true complexity of plant systems. As a result, it became my goal to expand the knowledge in the field to uncover the complex world of plants. Research in plant microRNA (miRNA) is a relatively new field in the scientific world. After the discovery of miRNA just a little over 20 years ago, these small RNAs with a length of 20 to 21 nucleotides have rightfully sparked the interest of scientists globally (“citation”). I was introduced to miRNAs during my internship at the systems biology lab at Yonsei University and instantly became hooked and applied to the master’s and PhD combination program. My time in research has been short and thus I have not yet discovered the challenges of my field, but if I were to have to pick one I would say it is the time it takes for plants to grow. The process of plant growth was once something wondrous and beautiful to me, but I have now come to be frustrated at the speed due to my impatience with my research. Although a lot of people might not understand the importance of the research in plants, miRNAs are a part of all living beings and their understanding might even help cure diseases in the future. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNA strands with an average length of twenty to twenty-one nucleotides which regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level in eukaryotic genomes. Through interaction with messenger RNAs (mRNAs), miRNAs can regulate gene expression and as such control the development, growth, stress response, and other physiological processes of plants. In my research, I am focussed on one protein in particular which plays a crucial role in the miRNA biogenesis pathway: the HYPONASTIC LEAVES1 (HYL1) protein. Research has revealed that the HYL1 protein also is an important factor in the photomorphogenesis pathway in plants. As such, the HYL1 protein forms a bridge between the photomorphogenesis and miRNA biogenesis pathways such that understanding this single protein will facilitate a new level of understanding of both pathways in plants. Although the HYL1 protein is only present in plant systems, a deeper understanding of the protein will result in a deeper understanding of miRNAs itself. MiRNAs are highly involved in many diseases (i.e., cancers, Alzheimer’s disease, type II diabetes, etc.) and understanding miRNAs will allow for better treatments. The original discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) in animals in 1993 was the starting point for the explosion of articles describing miRNAs in both animals and plants released between the years 2000 and 2003. MiRNAs are a class of endogenous, non-coding small RNAs with a length of twenty to twenty-one nucleotides which regulate gene expression (e.g. leaf morphogenesis, vegetative phase change, flowering time and response to environmental cues) at a post-transcriptional level in eukaryotic genomes through the silencing of messenger RNA (mRNA) via complementary binding. The double-stranded RNA-binding protein HYPONASTIC LEAVES1 (HYL1) creates a complex together with C2H2-type zinc finger protein SERRATE (SE) to assist the RNAse III DICER-Like1 (DCL1) protein, essential for the accurate processing of miRNA precursors in the plant cell nuclei. In 2021, HYPONASTIC LEAVES 1 (HYL1)-CLEAVAGE SUBTILASE 1 (HCS1) was found to be a cytoplasmic protease for HYL1-destabilization regulated by dark and light conditions through interaction with COP1 E3 ligase. Although research has revealed the role of HYL1 as a crucial link between the photomorphogenesis and miRNA biogenesis pathways, the exact function of HYL1 is unknown, inviting further research. MicroRNA (miRNA) biogenesis and photomorphogenesis are two major pathways in plants, which have recently been linked through a network containing the HYPONASTIC LEAVES 1 (HYL1) protein. In 2021, HYL1-CLEAVAGE SUBTILASE 1 (HCS1) was found to be a cytoplasmic protease for HYL1-destabilization, regulated by dark and light conditions through interaction with CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC (COP1) E3 ligase. Although HYL1 plays a critical role as a bridge between miRNA biogenesis and photomorphogenesis, the exact function of the protein has yet to be determined. The functional importance of the HYL1 protein for photomorphogenesis can be measured by observing the difference in hypocotyl length of wild-type (WT) saplings and HYL1 knockout mutant (hyl1-2) saplings grown in blue light conditions. After the significance of the HYL1 protein for photomorphogenesis is established, the evolution of this function can be explored by comparing the hypocotyl length of saplings between the ancient plant strain, Marchantia polymorpha (M. polymorpha) and the higher plant strain, Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana), grown in blue light conditions. Next, the localization of the photomorphogenic function of the HYL1 protein between the terminals can be explored by creating chimeric strains combining the N- and C-terminals of Arabidopsis thaliana and Marchantia polymorpha and observing the hypocotyl growth of the saplings.   RQ1. To what extent do wild-type plants (WT) differ from hyl1-2 plants in terms of hypocotyl length when grown in blue light conditions?  RQ2. At what time in evolution, between the ancient plant strain, Marchantia polymorpha and the higher plant strain, Arabidopsis thaliana, did the HYL1 protein obtain function for photomorphogenesis in terms of hypocotyl length in blue light conditions?  RQ3. To what extent does changing the C-terminal of the HYPONASTIC LEAVES 1 (HYL1) protein of Arabidopsis thaliana to the C-terminal of HYL1 of Marchantia polymorpha affect hypocotyl length in blue light conditions?   Exploring the exact function of the HYL1 protein within photomorphogenesis in plants can help further understand the workings of the light pathway. The HYL1 protein is a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding protein encoded by the HYL1 gene in plants, including Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) [1]. In past research, the HYL1 protein has been shown to form a complex with DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1) and SERRATE (SE) in the nucleus, which facilitates efficient and accurate processing of pri-microRNA (miRNA) into mature miRNA [2]. In 2021, HYL1-CLEAVAGE SUBTILASE 1 (HCS1) was found to be a cytoplasmic protease for HYL1-destabilization, regulated by dark and light conditions through interaction with CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC (COP1) E3 ligase, which plays a role in photomorphogenesis in plants by destabilizing light-regulated transcription factors and photoreceptors [3, 4]. As HYL1 is an important factor in both the COP1-HYL1-HCS3 network and the DCL1-SE-HYL1 complex, HYL1 becomes a critical link between photomorphogenesis and miRNA biogenesis. This recent discovery of HYL1 as a link between these two major pathways in plants invited further research into the specific workings of the HYL1 protein (e.g. evolution of the protein, localization of function within the protein).  To understand the evolution of the photomorphogenic function of the HYL1 protein an ancient plant strain, Marchantia polymorpha (M. polymorpha) can be compared with a recently evolved plant strain, A. thaliana. As plants moved from water to land, light exposure increased as water could no longer act as a light absorbing filter. M. polymorpha was the first land plant species and as such had not had the time to evolve according to the new environmental factors (i.e. light exposure) [5]. Given the new exposure to light, the photomorphogenic function of the HYL1 protein can be observed by growing saplings of A. thaliana and M. polymorpha in both dark and blue light conditions, measuring the hypocotyl growth, and comparing the lengths. With the hope of achieving a clear understanding of the HYL1 protein, three plant lines must be tested and compared: A. thaliana WT, A. thaliana HYL1 mutant line (hyl1-2), and an insertion line of the M. polymorpha HYL1 protein into the hyl1-2 mutant line. After confirming the workings of the HYL1 protein in both the WT line and hyl1-2 line in both dark and blue light conditions, the WT line will be used as the negative control in this experiment and the hyl1-2 line as the positive control. If the hypocotyl lengths of the insertion line in both dark and blue light conditions are similar to the WT line, it would mean that the HYL1 photomorphogenic function was recovered. On the other hand, if the hypocotyl lengths in both dark and blue light conditions are similar to the hyl1-2 line, the HYL1 photomorphogenic function is not active. Keeping these concepts in mind, the HYL1 protein function can be observed throughout evolution by looking at and comparing the hypocotyl lengths of A. thaliana and M. polymorpha. According to the results of this experiment, the research can be continued by constructing recombinant proteins of the A. thaliana and M. polymorpha HYL1 proteins by cross-combining the N- and C-terminals of the proteins. The same light experiments shall be performed as before to be able to observe the localization of the likely evolved photomorphogenic function of the HYL1 protein.         Each research question can be answered by comparing and contrasting the hypocotyl length with respect to the conditions referenced in each question. Considering RQ1, as the HYL1 protein has a significant function in photomorphogenesis in plants, mutating the protein will result in a differing phenotype of the hypocotyl [1]. An intricate system of growth factors affected by light can either cause the inhibition of elongation of the hypocotyl under light conditions (photomorphogenesis) and the promotion of elongation under dark conditions (skotomorphogensis) in Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) [2]. Correspondingly, the hypocotyl containing the functional HYL1 protein should promote photomorphogenesis and thus should yield a short hypocotyl phenotype, while the HYL1 mutant line (hyl1-2) will promote skotomorphogenesis and yield an elongated hypocotyl. According to these results, the HYL1 wild-type (WT) line will be used as the negative control and the HYL1 mutant line (hyl1-2) will be used as the positive control. Regarding RQ2, Marchantia polymorpha (M. polymorpha) is the first land plant in regards to plant evolution, which means that the photomorphogenic function of HYL1 is highly unlikely to have evolved yet, unlike A. thaliana [3]. In order to prove this hypothesis, the hypocotyl lengths of the HYL1 protein of both M. polymorpha and A. thaliana will be tested under dark and light conditions and compared to the control to draw conclusions. If the HYL1 protein in M. polymorpha indeed lacks the photomorphogenic function, and as such shows similar hypocotyl phenotypes as the positive control, such a result would support the conclusion that the photomorphogenic function was achieved later on in evolution likely due to the change exposure to light [4]. Once the function of HYL1 in photomorphogenesis is observed in terms of evolution, the localization of the function can be observed by conducting the same dark and light experiments on chimeric transgenic plants combining the N- and C-terminals of M. polymorpha and A. thaliana. Through comparison of the hypocotyl lengths of the constructed chimeras with the negative and positive controls, it will be possible to observe the localization of the photomorphogenic function within the HYL1 protein. As a result, the research will allow clarification of the function of the HYL1 protein in photomorphogenesis in both a structural and evolutionary context, building on previous research conducted on the HYL1 protein [1].   When considering the photomorphogenic function of the HYL1 protein in terms of both evolution and structure, questions can be raised regarding the validity of the conclusions drawn by answering RQ1-3. Through comparison of the hypocotyl phenotypes of M. polymorpha and A. thaliana in both blue light and dark conditions, with both each other as a point of reference, as well as a negative and positive control, a wild-type (WT) line and a HYL1 mutant line (hyl1-2), observations regarding the evolutionary acquisition of the photomorphogenic function of HYL1 can be made. A hypocotyl phenotype similar to the WT line would mean the HYL1 protein is active in photomorphogenesis, while a phenotype similar to the hyl1-2 line would mean no activity in photomorphogenesis (i.e., skotomorphogenesis). Although RQ2 can be answered, when exactly throughout evolution it was gained, cannot. Furthermore, the speculation that the acquisition is a result of a change in light exposure due to the removal of water as an absorbing factor, also cannot be proven. A persistent challenge in evolutionary biology is the fact that an evolutionary change occurred, can be shown, but the reason behind the change is difficult to demonstrate. Furthermore, the observation of the hypocotyl lengths of the chimeric transgenic plant strains combining the N- and C-terminals of M. polymorpha and A. thaliana to localize the photomorphogenic function within the HYL1 protein, will facilitate the formation of conclusions as to whether the function is localized in the N- or C-terminal of the protein. Further research on the exact localization is invited through structural analysis of the HYL1 protein. Therefore, although there limitations in the research questions, through further research these limitations could be addressed.
