  Robot technology plays a crucial role in complementing human abilities and overcoming limitations. Particularly, wearable robot technology for muscle strength assistance is recognized as a key field that can enhance the quality of human life, leading to widespread research. Wearable robots can be broadly categorized into exoskeletons utilizing rigid materials and soft wearable robots utilizing flexible materials. I wanted to research practical, real-world applicable robots, and I chose to focus on soft wearable robots because I believe they offer comfortable wear, lightweight, and safety, making them highly usable and promising in various applications. However, a drawback of soft wearable robots is their susceptibility to significant deformation due to the driving force of actuators, stemming from the use of soft materials. To address this issue, partially-rigid interfaces have been introduced, aiming to reduce power loss which is the main problem in soft wearable robots. Nevertheless, these partially-rigid interfaces have given rise to unintentional torque generation, leading to deformation in the human body. Deformation in the human body makes power loss.  To overcome this challenge, a chain-linking structure has been implemented to increase the contact area, thereby enhancing force transmission efficiency.  Robot technology, particularly wearable robot technology for muscle strength assistance, plays a crucial role in complementing human abilities and overcoming limitations. This robot technology leads to an increase in the performance of industrial workers and helps overcome limitations of the human body, such as improving strength and running speed.     Muscle strength assistance robots are mainly categorized into motor-driven wearable robots and pneumatic-driven wearable robots. Motor-driven wearable robots are robust, so they can be controlled very well and have a long stroke. However, they have a high load and bulky size, and they can't provide an impactful force at my desired timing. [1] Therefore, robots using artificial pneumatic actuators to overcome these drawbacks are currently being actively developed. Artificial pneumatic actuators can generate large forces at a desired timing and actuators are lightweight. However, artificial pneumatic actuators have such a short stroke range that artificial pneumatic actuators are difficult to apply to wearable robots. [2] Because of short stroke range it is important to deliver the initial forces as efficiently as possible without loss. Consequently, research has been conducted through the development of PHRI (physical human-robot interface) to reduce force loss.       Wearable robots, developed to enhance human abilities have evolved from exoskeletons using rigid material interfaces [1] over decades. However, the low compliance of rigid interfaces poses challenges in closely following the movements of the human body because rigid interfaces and human bodies are placed in parallel [2]. In contrast to exoskeletons, exosuits utilize soft material interfaces that can naturally adhere to the body, offering reduced resistance but being susceptible to deformations and slips when actuator forces are applied, thereby leading to force loss [3], [4]. Even though exosuits mainly utilize motors and pneumatic artificial actuators (PAMs) to apply assistive moments to the body, while motors are well-controlled, these actuators face technological challenges due to their heavy weight and bulk [4]. Thereby, instead of motors, PAMs are widely utilized, due to their advantages of having a higher weight-to-weight force compared to other actuators and utilizing air being environmentally friendly by utilizing air. However, their disadvantages, such as a strong initial force and a short stroke, result in actuators failing to properly transmit initial force when soft interfaces slip significantly, leading to significant force loss [3]. Hybrid anchoring, achieved by adding a semi-rigid shell to a soft material and applying fixing force through webbing results in a force efficiency similar to that of rigid interfaces. However, since this hybrid anchoring was developed to distribute the force applied to the knee throughout the legs, it was not suitable for improving physical force and speed of human movement [5]. Therefore, I intend to develop a lightweight interface that effectively transmits forces by analyzing the points where actuators apply forces to interfaces and where interfaces transmit forces to the bodies, and then incorporating rigid materials into these points. Pilots wearing exosuits made for experimental purposes conducted running tests, resulting in a 20% improvement in force transmission ratio. Thereby, the new interface, which incorporates partially rigid materials alongside soft materials, can increase force transmission ratio.         Though numerous researchers have developed exoskeletons using rigid interfaces [1-2], which exhibit drawbacks such as heavy-weight due to the use of rigid and high-density materials (e.g., aluminum), and low-compliance (i.e., the ability of interfaces to track human movements) [3]. In contrast exosuits employing soft interfaces have become the focus of research because they are lightweight and high compliance, and can tend to deform easily when actuators apply force in their direction aligned with actuators' directions. Accordingly, this research proposes the development of a hybrid interface that combines soft materials and rigid materials. Specifically, this research project includes development of a partially soft interface by adding rigid materials into the points where actuators apply force to interfaces, ensuring efficient force transmission to the body while maintaining lightweight and high compliance for pilots’ comfort. The effectiveness of this hybrid interface will be evaluated based on factors such as force transmission compared to the no-assistance state, which pilots are only wearing the wearable robot in a zero-force state, precise force control, and user comfort. Assessment methods will include load cells, force plates, force gauges, and qualitative surveys.  RQ1. To what extent can a wearable robot using a hybrid interface affect leg force compared to the no-assistance state? RQ2. To what extent can a wearable robot featuring a hybrid interface affect precise force control compared to other wearable robots using different actuators? RQ3. To what extent can a wearable robot featuring a hybrid interface influence pilots' perceptions (e.g., sense of assistance, comfort)?  In this way, the hybrid interface aims to enhance wearable robots' tracking ability with natural human movements, improve force transmission and control capabilities, and ultimately enhance user abilities.    To enhance human abilities, particularly speed and strength, wearable robots are currently under investigation in the field of wearable robots [1]. Assessing the performance of these robots primarily involves measuring metabolic cost, speed, and force metrics. Some studies have evaluated the metabolic cost during running to assess the assistance provided by wearable robots. A reduction in metabolic cost indicates that wearable robots offer physical assistance to human muscles during running. However, metabolic cost tests may not adequately address assessing speed improvements as the tests are typically conducted at fixed speeds. By comparing speeds in the no-assist state (i.e., pilots wear the wearable robot in a zero-force state), no-suit state, and assist state, the effectiveness of wearable robots in increasing sprint speed can be demonstrated [2]. To assess the performance of Hybrid Anchoring, which combines soft and semi-rigid materials for lightweight and efficient force transmission, systemic stiffness (i.e., force-to-distance) was measured using a testbed that applies tensile force to the interface [3]. Higher systemic rigidity enables quicker reactions to external forces, resulting in better tracking of the master’s control (i.e., those who control the wearable robots). Finally, the weight of the wearable robots and the distance between the interface and joint were measured to evaluate comfort. Inertia is proportional to both the mass of the object and the distance from the interface connected point to the human body joint, such as the hip joint. This means that as the weight or the distance between the interface and human body joints increases, inertia also increases, consequently impeding human movement [1].  In this study, the performance of the new interface was demonstrated by measuring running speed, systemic rigidity, and physical specifications (i.e., weight, size, distance joint-interface) between the conventional interface and the new hybrid interface of the same wearable robot.    Answers to the above research questions require verification testing and modeling of force transmission between a wearable robot interface and the human body. Regarding RQ1, comparing running times with and without a wearable robot demonstrates the primary objective of hip-assistance wearable robots to improve running performance [1]. For RQ2, a systematic comparing stiffness test records (force-distance) of conventional and hybrid interfaces is conducted by applying tensile force to the wearable robot interface. Since tests with human participants are subject to numerous uncertainties including variations in body size, weight, and running posture, leading to differing experimental results, 12 participants meeting certain physical criteria (age, 25.5 ± 6.1 years; mass, 75.4 ± 8.26 kg; height, 1.78 ± 0.05 m) were recruited to mitigate these uncertainties [3]. Following recruitment, the same tests were conducted twice, and then the mean and standard deviation of the data were calculated to reduce the influence of uncertainties [3]. Concerning RQ3,development of a wearable robot model requires incorporating factors such as force transmission, interface weight, and the distance from the human joint to the interface, such that the model can adequately explore the impact of the model on the force transmission rate between the body and the interface. As the weight of robot interfaces increases, and the distance from human joints to the interface increases, the inertia of the robot also increases, consequently impeding the person's free movement. [4] Therefore, if these approaches (tests and modeling) verify the data (speed, systematic stiffness, inertia) then these wearable robots are suitable for improving running ability and comfort.       When measuring human sprint speed using wearable robots, various challenges arise due to individual variations such as different running postures, running conditions (i.e., stride, cadence - the number of steps taken per minute), and diversity of human anatomy. To address the problem stemming from the varying running postures, participants were instructed to adopt a heel strike posture during running, striking the ground from heel to toe. However, constraining running posture may limit the applicability of wearable robots. Therefore, additional experiments with different postures such as toe strike (striking the ground only using a toe) and midfoot strike (striking the ground from midfoot to toe) are necessary.   To maintain consistency in running conditions, participants were instructed to maintain a pace of 180 cadence and a stride length of 150cm. While participants' running speed improved under these conditions, maintaining consistent conditions might reduce reliability. Therefore, instead of requiring participants to maintain a consistent speed, it is essential to conduct the tests under randomized running conditions. To achieve random running conditions, wearable robot sensing technology is developed to sense and analyze human movement using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and stretch sensor. By leveraging this analyzed data, wearable robots can evaluate individual movements and provide tailored assistance.   Lastly, considering the diversity of human anatomy, testing with a group of 12 individuals and calculating the mean and standard deviation of results will validate the performance of wearable robots [1].
