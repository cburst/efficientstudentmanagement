 I am interested in the field of Biomaterials and medical engineering. Thus far, I had thought that diseases or deaths would never happen around me. However, some of my friends have passed away from incidents like an acute stroke over the past few years. People live in the real world where death is always possible. Given such inevitable circumstances, I thought that what I could do as a researcher in the field of material science and engineering is to fabricate bioelectronics that can be used in people’s daily lives.  Bioresorbable electronics constitute a promising technology in the field of medicine as they can be dosed to patients multiple times and applied locally improving the disadvantages of general medicines and surgical operations. Previous fabrication tools (i.e.  photolithography) cannot be used in this field because they require wet conditions and thermal processing which can deform the bioresorbable materials. Therefore, high-speed pulsed laser ablation which is conducted in dry condition and involves almost no thermal diffusion  is needed to treat the materials. Although it works, high resolution is only obtained in thin films. Materials that have a large thickness cannot be ablated precisely due to the high energy release rate value leading to a lack of flexibility.  My goal of research is to solve the problem I mentioned above. My objective is to enhance the resolution and reliability of the laser tool in the ablation of thick materials by using the adhesive property of an encapsulation polymer constituting bioresorbable electronics. Improved resolution could give us more options in choosing materials and controlling the functional lifetime of the device. Then, this research would bring the expansion of a range where devices can be adapted.  Transient electronics have emerged as they are required for medical implants functioning within time frames sustainable for treating patients who need temporal care. An initial report concerning transient electronics was released about a decade ago, containing theoretical design tools for a silicon-based complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology that could be adapted for biosensors [1]. Originating with this first novel concept, metals that could be degraded by body fluids in a biocompatible manner (e.g., Magnesium, Molybdenum, and Tungsten) were studied for use in transient electronics [2]. After preliminary studies, multiple researchers suggested several bioelectronic devices (e.g., brain sensors) for neurophysiologic applications and these concepts formed a robust foundation of capabilities in bioresorbable implantable technologies [3-4]. Then, the development of polymer encapsulations enabled control of the duration of bioresorbable electronics confirming effective operations without dissolving during designated functional times [5-6]. This series of developments in transient electronics in the biomedical field, played an important role in temporary cardiac pacing leading to elimination of danger associated with lead extraction and serious infections resulting from percutaneous holes [7]. Currently, a temporary cardiac pacing  has been developed to enable patients’ dehospitalization during post-operative autonomous electrotherapy via a closed-loop network system [8].    Though numerous researchers have developed patterning technologies (e.g., screen printing, photolithography), those methods were not suitable to fabricate components in electronic devices constituted with bioresorbable materials. It’s because previous patterning technologies include wet process using solutions, and high temperature conditions heating up to about 130 degree celsius, which can damage bioresorbable materials [1]. To solve this problem, scientists have investigated brand new technologies named “pulsed-laser ablation” that can overcome disadvantages in former fabrication technologies mentioned above. Though this laser patterning can process various patterns without manipulating bioresorbable materials, even enabling multi-layered designs [2], such works only can be achieved when treating thin films with nanometer-scale thickness. If materials get thicker up to micrometer-scale, they lose their flexibility and become impossible to stick on the ground during patterning. Therefore, this research project will focus on enhancing resolutions in ablation of thick materials using adhesive polymers, which are used in bioresorbable electronics as encapsulations.  RQ1. To what extent can pulsed-laser ablation get higher resolutions to fabricating bioresorbable electronics than photolithography? RQ2. To what extent laser ablation can be done in terms of thickness of ablated materials without decreasing resolutions? RQ3. To what extent can we increase resolutions when patterning thick materials using adhesive polymer underlayer during pulsed-laser patterning?  In this way, this research project will investigate changes in resolutions when patterning thick bioresorbable materials. Also, the point that using originally composed encapsulant polymers brings procedural advantages of removing additional unnecessary processes and enabling perfect alignment in multi-layered structures.  In order to yield maximum resolution in the fabrication of electronic components (e.g., serpentine electrodes, coils), Q. Yang et al applied a novel technique “laser overlapping” thereby achieving resolution values of 5 micrometers, which is a value that has never been obtained previously [1]. Researchers measured the widths of ablated metals by using optical microscopy, scattering electronic microscopy, and atomic force microscopy [2]. Though these tools can determine even a few nanometers [3], I cannot utilize some of these tools as the thicknesses of the samples I’m dealing with are beyond their measurement range. Therefore, I propose 3-dimensional confocal microscopy as a characterization technique. Then, to address the necessity of adhesive property, I would compare cases of ablation of thick metals with different adhesive properties of encapsulant polymers. Since researchers previously proved they can easily control the adhesive properties of encapsulant polymers by changing the amount of curing agents [4], this comparison would bring the contribution of adhesion energy to the resolutions in laser ablation.         Answers to the above questions require certain experimental trials and the collection of data from previous investigations. Considering RQ1, previous research studies would indicate a value of 5 micrometers in the fabrication of bioresorbable electronics while it is impossible to utilize photolithography due to disrupting bioresorbable materials [1]. In terms of RQ2, the ablation of metals with a thickness of about 10 micrometers would provide answers to this question. Based on the energy release rate, which is the origin of materials’ flexibility, this degree of thickness would be proper to define ‘thick’ and show different characteristics during ablations compared to thin films previously dealt with in other studies [2]. Considering the experiment results currently in progress, about 50 micrometers would be the maximum resolution value when cutting thick metals using a pulsed laser. After confirming answers to RQ2, laser ablation with adhesive polymer underlayers may reveal solutions related to RQ3. This research project would utilize b-DCPU with an 80% crosslinking (i.e., covalent bonds among polymer chains) ratio as the adhesive polymer, an approach researchers are currently employing in the medical field due to its high adhesion energy and high biocompatibility. Researchers hypothesize that resolution would increase up to 5 micrometers when there is an adhesive layer under ablated samples.  When assessing the resolution of a laser, various challenges emerge in determining its maximum capability. First, the criteria distinguishing the maximum ability of laser ablation is very ambiguous. For instance, if an object has been unevenly cut but still maintains its shape, some might assume this constitutes the maximum resolution. Alternatively, other researchers could define the point where the sample is cut uniformly. Second, limitation also arises with respect to the laser cutting method used in this research project. While the purpose of this research project is enhancing the resolution of laser ablation when cutting thick metal films using an adhesive underlayer, the mechanical properties of the underlayer also affect the resolution. Though the laser pulse is ultrashort, which operates at the nanosecond scale, the laser's thermal energy may inadvertently damage the adhesive layer composed of soft polymeric materials.
