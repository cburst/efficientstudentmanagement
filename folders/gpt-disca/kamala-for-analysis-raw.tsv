Gavin Newsom shared his remarks on X Wednesday following Vice President Kamala Harris' loss in the 2024 presidential election. Newsom expressed that a second Trump presidency is 'not the outcome we wanted,' but the 'fight for freedom and opportunity endures.' '.@KamalaHarris set out to fight to defend our fundamental freedoms and build a country that works for everyone. She stood up for working families, decency, and opportunity,' Newsom wrote. 'California will seek to work with the incoming president -- but let there be no mistake, we intend to stand with states across our nation to defend our Constitution and uphold the rule of law.' He continued: 'Federalism is the cornerstone of our democracy. It's the United STATES of America.'

((AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson)) President-elect Donald Trump has made many comments trashing the Biden administration's handling of the war in Ukraine and alluded to how he could end the war as early as inauguration day. Now, he's in the hot seat and it seems he's going to need to decide how to make due on that. During an interview with host Maria Bartiromo on 'Sunday Morning Futures' in 2023, Trump said his relationships with Zelenskyy and Putin were the key. 'I know Zelenskyy very well, and I know Putin very well, even better. And I had a good relationship, very good with both of them. I would tell Zelenskyy, no more. You got to make a deal. I would tell Putin, if you don't make a deal, we're going to give him a lot. We're going to [give Ukraine] more than they ever got if we have to. I will have the deal done in one day. One day,' Trump said. According to the Wall Street Journal, a former Trump National Security Council aide said, 'Anyone-no matter how senior in Trump's circle-who claims to have a
2024110710582	different view or more detailed window into his plans on Ukraine simply doesn't know what he or she is talking about or doesn't understand that he makes his own calls on national-security issues, many times in the moment, particularly on an issue as central as this.' The president-elect spoke to the Ukrainian leader as late as Wednesday and has agreed to maintain close dialogue and cooperation. Pollster Frank Luntz explains to 'Fox News @ Night' how President-elect Trump exceeded polling projections and why Vice President Harris's actions were a direct impact on this election. 'She never actually told voters exactly what she would do in the first hour, in the first day, in the first week, in the first month, and voters have the right to know. She had the responsibility to tell them,' said Luntz. 'In the end, when she turned on him, Trump, started to call him all sorts of really horrific things. And, in the last week or 10 days, started calling him a fascist. Her negative started to go up, her popularity started to go down, and I think that that was a significant impact.' 'Don't forget, Republicans also gain seats in the Senate, and it looks like they're going to end up in control of the House,' said Luntz. 'This was not just a Donald Trump victory last night. This was a Republican victory up and down the ticket and there's going to be some reckoning in Washington in the next weeks and months.'

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Former - and future - first lady Melania Trump said she and President-elect Donald Trump have been entrusted by the American people to 'safeguard' freedom following the GOP nominee's landslide win in the 2024 presidential election. In a post on X on Wednesday afternoon, Melania said the Trump administration will protect freedom, which she described as 'the heart of our republic.' 'I anticipate the citizens of our nation rejoining in commitment to each other and rising above ideology for the sake of individual liberty, economic prosperity, and security,' she wrote in part. 'American energy, skill, and initiative will bring together our best minds to propel our nation forward forevermore.' Former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy took to X following his appearance on 'Hannity' tonight expressing his excitement at the election results and the promise of a more united front. 'We're more united than divided. Last night's results prove it. A new Republican Party is emerging, one that speaks to all Americans.' Ramaswamy's appearance shared an opinion that seems to be a common theme since the historic win for President-elect Donald Trump 'Sean, we get out of the echo chambers on the internet and just talk to people from Pennsylvania to Iowa to the West Coast of Nevada. We found that most Americans share the same common values. It was a beautiful thing to watch last night, and I think there was going to be a couple of good things to come out of it,' said Ramaswamy. 'Number one is, I think we're going to see a resurgence of national unity. Young people coming along in droves for Republicans. This is a new coalition. This is a new Republican party. This is a new country,' Ramaswamy said. 'The other positive thing. As a result of that, I think we're going to see, Sean, is a Democratic Party that at least finds its way back to sanity.' 'The Democratic Party is going to have to let go of the crazies on the progressive left and find its North Star again or else
2024110710583	the Democratic Party is dead and either way that's a good win for the country,' he said. 'So we're still learning a lot from those election results, but the number one learning is there is a new coalition or united and there's unity to save this country and I'm excited that we're going to be a part of it.' Former presidential candidate, former Arkansas governor governor Mike Huckabee, believes President-elect Donald Trump's win was 'authentic on his part' and the work of 'a brilliant campaign.' On the 'The Evening Edit' Huckabee praised him saying he might as well be called 'President Lazarus.' 'Yeah, this wasn't a comeback. It was a resurrection, and it was a powerful one. He might be called President Lazarus after this, but I'll tell you what he said last night that was so very important for people to take in.this was not just an election about Donald Trump, this is a real movement, a genuine movement and a complete realignment of the political class' said Huckabee. Huckabee believes the American people have finally had their fill and Trump is their champion. 'We're just fed up with it and they're tired of Democrats and some of these Republicans who only care about their own globalist interests and they care about they're making money. And they didn't care that what they were doing and their policies were just strong jobs in this country,' said Huckabee. 'They were destroying their families and households and small communities and farms, and finally people had enough and Donald Trump was willing to carry the banner. He's done it brilliantly. He put together a coalition of people that most thought could never happen. He ran the tables. It's an overwhelming vote of support for a different kind of political. And I couldn't be happier,' he said. U.S. Senator Rick Scott took to X Wednesday evening reinforcing his commitment to support President-elect Donald Trump's agenda stating 'We have been given a mandate by the American people to support President Trump's agenda and Make Washington WORK again. I'm running to be the next Senate Majority leader to do just that. #LetsGetToWork.' Scott appeared on Kudlow and announced he will be running to be and will win the next Senate majority leader. 'I'm going to run. Larry, I'm going to win, and here's why,' said Scott. 'I've been talking to my Republican colleagues. Guess what they want? Change? They know that Trump has a mandate. They want to be part of that mandate. They don't want to be treated as equals. They want to be part of a team. They want to have a working relationship with the House. They know I've got a great working relationship with Trump, with Speaker Mike Johnson.' 'They know I'm a businessman. Businessmen get things done. We create a plan, we work our mission, we measure things, we create teams. That's exactly what we want in the Senate, and that's why I'll be the next majority leader, and we're going to get Trump's agenda accomplished.'

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) President-elect Trump will begin choosing members to serve in his second administration, Trump-Vance Transition Co-Chairs Linda McMahon and Howard Lutnick said in a joint statement on Wednesday. 'Since the formation of President Trump's transition organization and our announcement as Co-Chairs in August,
2024110710584	we have been preparing for President Trump's next administration,' the statement said. 'In the days and weeks ahead, President Trump will be selecting personnel to serve our nation under his leadership and enact policies that make the life of Americans affordable, safe, and secure.' 'We are proud to volunteer our time to present President Trump with a wide array of experts from which he can select for his team,' they added. The statement said voters gave Trump a mandate 'that puts the working men and women of our nation first. As he chooses the best people to join his team and best policies to pursue, his transition team will ensure the implementation of President Trump's common sense agenda starting on Day 1.' Speaker of the House Mike Johnson shared his ambitions for the House of Representatives on the Ingraham Angle on Wednesday night after Republicans maintained their majority in Tuesday's elections. Johnson hopes to keep his seat as Speaker. His appearance on the show underscored a letter he shared with colleagues and the general public on proposed GOP policy goals for Congress. 'We can secure our borders, prioritize the needs of Americans above foreigners, promote investment and opportunity through the tax code, return to American energy dominance, dramatically reduce regulations, expand school choice, end the woke agenda, and restore fiscal sanity to Washington-among other pressing items,' read Speaker Johnson's letter. 'The American people have shown by their votes that they are ready to turn from the misery of the past four years and embark on a brighter, bolder path that is marked not by big government, bureaucratic control, poverty, inflation and wokeness-but by liberty, security, strength, prosperity and opportunity,' concluded the letter. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, also a Louisianan, threw his hat in the ring to keep his position as well. Governor Tim Walz, the running mate of Vice President Kamala Harris, took to the social media site X on Wednesday after Harris formally conceded, thanking her for the opportunity. 'Thank you Vice President @KamalaHarris for putting your faith in me, and selecting me as your running mate,' wrote Walz. 'Campaigning at your side was the honor and privilege of my life.' 'While the outcome is not what we wanted, I am grateful to the millions of Americans who joined our campaign and stood up for our greatest ideals: decency, compassion, and love of our neighbor. Now more than ever, we need you to continue fighting for those values and the country we all love,' his post concluded. Walz' post currently has over 14,000 likes. Ritchie Torres blamed progressive Democrats for President-elect Trump's win on Tuesday. (Getty Images) A Democratic congressman from New York recently blamed progressives for President-elect Trump's victory this week, arguing that far-left causes actually disenchant certain voters. Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., claimed that his party has 'alienated historic numbers' of minority voters in an X (former Twitter) post on Wednesday. Torres, a vocal supporter of Israel, pointed fingers at pro-Palestinian protests as one of the causes - as well as the movement to defend police. 'Donald Trump has no greater friend than the far left, which has managed to alienate historic numbers of Latinos, Blacks, Asians, and Jews from the Democratic Party with absurdities like 'Defund the Police' or 'From the River to the Sea' or 'Latinx,' Torres wrote. 'There is more to lose than there is to gain politically from pandering to a far left that is more representative of Twitter, Twitch,
2024110710585	and TikTok than it is of the real world,' the Democrat added. 'The working class is not buying the ivory-towered nonsense that the far left is selling.' Torres' comments came in the aftermath of the initial 2024 election results, which found that Vice President Harris had less favorability among Latino and Hispanic voters than President Biden did in 2020. According to a Fox News Voter Analysis, Biden garnered 63% of Latino support in 2020 while Harris only had 54% this year. Another Fox News Voter Analysis found that support for Trump among Latino and Hispanic voters jumped from 35% in 2020 to 41% in 2024. Fox News Digital's Andrea Margolis contributed to this report.

(Photographer: Samuel Corum/Sipa/Bloomberg via Getty Images) President Biden will address the nation from the Rose Garden at 11 a.m. ET on Thursday, the White House said. The televised address will come days after Vice President Kamala Harris lost to President-elect Trump in Tuesday's election. Harris conceded the election Wednesday. In a letter, her campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon called it 'unfathomably painful.' 'This will take a long time to process. But the work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump Presidency starts now,' she vowed. Catholic voters across the country swung massively towards Donald Trump in the 2024 election, contributing to his surprise blowout victory on election night.Catholics were evenly split between President Joe Biden and Trump in 2020, with 50 percent favoring Trump to 49 percent favoring Biden. According to exit polling collected by Fox News on election night, Catholics across the country swung nine percentage points in Trump's favor, with the former and now-future president winning Catholics by 10 points. Bill Donohue, president of the religious civil rights group the Catholic League, told Fox News Digital that Catholics resoundingly rejected Harris because of what he called a 'clear animus against Catholics.' 'She was rejected primarily because she is associated with the politics of extremism, and that is something the American people will never countenance,' he said. There are approximately 52 million Catholic adults in the U.S., making it the largest religious denomination in the country. Until now, political opinions among Catholic voters have been split between the two parties, leading many to believe that there is no such thing as a Catholic voting bloc. But after Tuesday's election results, Brian Burch, president of the conservative activism group CatholicVote, is saying that Catholic voters proved that theory wrong. 'There is an emerging electoral trend here that Republicans, if they are smart,
2024110710586	will latch onto,' he told Fox News Digital. Fox News Digital's Peter Pinedo contributed to this report. Former President Bill Clinton and wife Hillary released their official statement after fellow Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris conceded the race to President-elect Trump on Wednesday. In the Clintons' remarks, they claimed 'Kamala Harris and Tim Walz ran a positive, forward looking campaign to be proud of.' They also wished President-elect Donald Trump and running mate JD Vance well, saying they 'hope they will govern for all of us.' 'We must remember that America is bigger than the results of any one election, and what we as citizens do now will make the difference between a nation that moves forward or one that falls back,' continued the statement.

(AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib, File) Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Wednesday said Senate Democrats remain committed to working with Republicans, a day after the GOP gained a majority in the congressional chamber. 'Vice President Kamala Harris's historic candidacy inspired millions and her vision for a better future for all Americans will endure. Her advocacy on many issues - from lower costs, more affordable housing, and a fairer tax system- will continue to have strong impacts on America and on our party,' Schumer said in a statement. 'As we await the final tallies in elections across the country, Senate Democrats remain committed to our values and to working with our Republican colleagues to deliver for the American people,' he added. Schumer noted the only way to get things done in the Senate is through bipartisan legislation while maintaining its principles. 'The next two years will be no different,' he said.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) President Biden said selecting Vice President Kamala Harris was one of his best decisions and represents the best of America. In his first remarks after her election loss to President-elect Trump, Biden said Harris ran a 'historic campaign that embodied what's possible when guided by a strong moral compass and a clear vision for a nation that is more free, more just, and full of more opportunities for all Americans.' 'As I've said before, selecting Kamala was the very first decision I made when I became the nominee for president in 2020. It was the best decision I made,' he said. 'Her story represents the best of America's story. And as she made clear today, I have no doubt that she'll continue writing that story.' He added that Harris will continue to be a champion for all Americans and lead for generations as she 'puts her stamp on America's future.'

'Congratulations

'Dear Donald, I did not see the program, but Mrs. Nixon told me that you were really great on the Donahue Show,' Nixon wrote. 'As you can imagine, she is an expert on politics and she predicts that whenever you decide to run for office you will be a winner!'

The former Democrat has campaigned extensively to improve the health of the American people. According to Kennedy, President-elect Trump has requested he prioritize three things while in-office: '1. Clean up the corruption in our government health agencies. 2. Return those agencies to their rich tradition of gold-standard, evidence-based science. 3. Make America Healthy Again by ending the chronic disease epidemic.' It is unclear what kind of appointment this would translate to for Kennedy in Trump's cabinet, but many have speculated that it could be an FDA position.

'It's been the honor of a lifetime to speak on behalf of President Trump and this historic campaign.' She recalled the feeling of 'joy' when the race was officially called while backstage during an election night party. 'In that moment, all of the blood, sweat, and tears were instantly worth it,' she wrote. 'Thank you President Trump for going through hell in your selfless pursuit to Save America.'

'The Democratic Party proved itself to be fundamentally undemocratic. It needs a complete reboot,' wrote Ackman. 'The leadership should be thrown out and those responsible should apologize to the American people.' In the same post, Ackman praised how social media site X, bolstered by Elon Musk's drive for free speech on the platform, brought President-elect Trump to victory. 'Half the country has believed that @X is filled with mis- and disinformation, and that they could only therefore rely on The NY Times, MSNBC, CNN and other mainstream media for their news. And they did,' wrote Ackman. 'If, however, you have been active on @X for the last year, you have known the truth days, weeks and often months before the facts appear in the MSM.' According to Ackman, the mainstream media sought to portray President Biden to be 'fit as a fiddle' while simultaneously defaming President-elect Trump. He credits new media like podcasts for offering a different picture of Donald Trump to the American people. Ackman has 1.5 million followers on X. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appeared somber and teary-eyed while waiting to see defeated candidate Vice President Harris make a concession speech on Wednesday. Arriving at Howard University on Wednesday afternoon, Pelosi was photographed greeting Harris supporters while appearing tearful. In a particularly emotional picture, Pelosi pouted as if just about to weep, and had watery eyes. Other pictures showed Pelosi smiling at the event and mingling with attendees. Harris' concession speech comes after a historic neck-and-neck presidential race ended with a Trump victory early Wednesday morning. While the election was expected to be a toss-up, the scope of Trump's victory shocked both sides of the
2024110710589	political aisle. Pelosi and Trump have a great deal of enmity towards each other, regularly insulting each other in public. During a speech in Grand Rapids, Michigan, this week, Trump described Pelosi as something that 'starts with a B.' 'She's an evil, sick, crazy.,' the Republican candidate said, stopping short. 'It starts with a B, but I won't say it. I wanna say it.' Pelosi has returned the jabs back to Trump in the past, and recently claimed that he was suffering from 'cognitive degeneration' during a recent appearance on MSNBC.

Tim Walz, who both 'ran a remarkable campaign,' in a Wednesday statement. 'This is obviously not the outcome we had hoped for, given our disagreements with the Republican ticket on a whole host of issues,' Obama said in a joint statement with his wife, Michelle Obama. 'But living in a democracy is about recognizing that one point of view won't always win out, and being willing to accept the peaceful transfer of power.' Issues like the COVID-19 pandemic and economic struggles for voters created 'headwinds for Democratic incumbents in recent years,' Obama said. 'And last night showed that America is not immune,' he said. 'In a country as big as ours, we won't always see eye-to-eye on everything,' he added. 'But progress requires us to extend good faith and grace - even to people with whom we deeply disagree.' US Vice President Kamala Harris speaks at Howard University in Washington, DC, on November 6, 2024. Donald Trump won a sweeping victory Wednesday in the US presidential election, defeating Kamala Harris to complete an astonishing political comeback that sent shock waves around the world. (Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images) Vice President Kamala Harris delivered her concession speech to the American people at Howard University in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday afternoon. Her address came hours after calling President-elect Donald Trump to concede earlier today. The delayed timing echoes former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's concession in 2016, who also waited until the next day to deliver her concession. Harris walked out to the podium wearing a black pantsuit, with the crowd cheering as Beyonce's 'Freedom' played in the background. 'My heart is full today, full of gratitude,' opened Harris.Harris thanked President Biden, her family, and the Walz family before thanking her supporters and volunteers. 'I am so proud of the race we ran and the way we ran it.' 'Now I know folks are feeling and experiencing a range of emotions right now, I get it. But we must accept the results of this election.' Harris then mentioned calling President-elect Trump to concede the race, and the crowd audibly booed. Harris also said that she will accept the results of the election and will certify the results on January 6, but added loyalty must be to the Constitution first and foremost. 'While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign: the fight for freedom, for opportunity, for fairness, for the dignity of all people.' Harris reiterated her positions on guns and
20241107105810	abortion, as part of the fight she will continue to uphold: 'We will continue to wage this fight in the voting booth, in the courtroom, in the public square.' Harris also comforted her younger supporters, saying 'to the young people who are watching, it is okay to feel sad and disappointed. But please know it's going to be okay.' 'This is not a time to throw up our hands, but to roll up our sleeves,' Harris added. Vice President Kamala Harris' abiding silence following President-elect Trump's victory suggests an inability to step up as a leader for her base, legal scholars say. The Democratic nominee has not yet spoken to her supporters, nor encouraged them to accept the election results, since Trump was named the victor of the 2024 presidential race early Wednesday morning. Two sources confirmed to Fox that the Harris campaign was radio silent Wednesday morning and did not provide talking points to surrogates, donors or influencers. The vice president is expected to deliver remarks at Howard University at 4 p.m. EST on Wednesday, where she will address Americans for the first time since losing the presidential race to Trump. However, analysts say she should not have waited until the afternoon after the election to address her base. Jonathan Turley, a legal scholar and a Fox News contributor, said Trump's clear path to victory should have prompted her to concede sooner. 'The true test of leadership is to step forward when it is most needed. Half of this population is deeply aggrieved by this decision. Part of that angst and anxiety was fueled by the rage rhetoric and panic politics on the left, including the Harris campaign,' Turley told Fox News Digital. The Fox News Decision Desk projects that Democrat Rep. Elissa Slotkin will defeat former Republican Rep. Mike Rogers, to succeed longtime Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan. Slotkin's challenger, Republican Mike Rogers, served as a Representative in Michigan's 8th Congressional district from 2001 through 2015. Slotkin is projected to win with 99% of the vote reported with a narrow margin of 48.6% over Rogers' 48.3%. She is a former CIA Middle East analyst and current Representative for Michigan's 7th Congressional district. At least three Senate seats have been flipped thus far for the GOP in the 2024 elections. Vice President Kamala Harris standing up her devastated Democratic supporters last night is drawing attention to a similar choice by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in November 2016. Both Democrats would have become the country's first female president if they beat Trump. In 2016, when the race was called for Trump, Clinton did not address her supporters until the following morning. Harris will speak to supporters Wednesday evening. At the time, some critics blasted Clinton for not giving a consolation speech that same night at the Javits Center in New York. Clinton instead allowed her campaign manager, John Podesta, to briefly speak to supporters. On the following day, Clinton urged her supporters to 'accept this result, and then look to the future.' 'Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead,' she said. Likewise, on Tuesday night, Harris supporters trickled out of the watch party at Howard University once they learned from a Harris spokesperson she would not be addressing the crowd. Users on social media quickly took note and critiqued the VP for not showing face after supporters waited hours for her to come out. Harris-Walz campaign manager David Plouffe took to social media to thank staff and lament Vice President
20241107105811	Kamala Harris' 'devastating loss.' 'It was a privilege to spend the last 100 days with @KamalaHarris and the amazing staff led by @jomalleydillon who left it all on the field for their country,' Plouffe wrote on X. 'We dug out of a deep hole but not enough. A devastating loss. Thanks for being in the arena, all of you.' In the wake of former President Donald Trump's historic win projected by the Fox News Decision Desk, several winners and losers of the 2024 election have become clear. Here are those who came out on top on Election Day and those who didn't quite meet expectations. Winners Trump Trump defied all expectations, even some of the more conservative-leaning estimates of the 2024 election. By notable margins, Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in several key battleground states, being projected by the Fox News Decision Desk to win the election by amassing the necessary 270 electoral votes before a number of other top swing states had been called. Republicans Trump's top of the ticket projected victory was followed by significant victories for Republicans across the board. Senate Republicans were projected by the Fox News Decision Desk to retake the majority in the Senate in 2025, racking up wins in West Virginia, Ohio and Montana, which were previously blue. There are still multiple outstanding Senate races in swing states, giving the party hope for an even larger majority. Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes is projected to survive her closely watched re-election bid by defeating her GOP challenger. The Associated Press called the race for Ohio's 13th Congressional District for Sykes over former Ohio state Sen. Kevin Coughlin on Wednesday just before 3 p.m. ET. Sykes, a first-term Democrat who won in 2022 by five points, was defending her seat in a district that includes parts of two counties that former President Trump comfortably won in 2020. 'This is as 50/50 of a district as it comes,' Sykes said. 'It has been rated as such all across the country and there are all eyes on Ohio's 13th Congressional District.' Sykes comes from a well-established political family in Akron. Both her parents served as state lawmakers and her father, Vernon Sykes, currently serves as a state senator in Ohio. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images Rep. Normal Torres, is projected to win reelection the U.S. House, according to a call by the Associated Press. Torres defeated Republican challenger Mike Cargile in the race for California's 35th Congressional District. Torres has served in Congress since 2015 and previously served in the California State House an Assembly from 2008-2014. The call comes as the balance of power in the House of Representatives is still up for grabs, with the Fox News Decision Desk projecting that Republicans currently have a lead in the race to maintain their majority, though the Decision Desk has yet to call the race for the GOP. The Justice Department is looking to wind down two federal criminal cases against President-elect Donald Trump as he prepares to be sworn in to a second term in the White House- a decision that upholds longstanding policy that prevents Justice Department attorneys from prosecuting a sitting president. In making this argument, Justice Department officials cited a memo from the Office of Legal Counsel filed in 2000, which upholds a Watergate-era argument that asserts it is a violation of the separation of powers doctrine for the Justice Department to investigate a sitting president. It further notes that such proceedings would 'unduly interfere in a direct or formal sense with the
20241107105812	conduct of the Presidency.' 'In light of the effect that an indictment would have on the operations of the executive branch, 'an impeachment proceeding is the only appropriate way to deal with a President while in office,'' the memo said in conclusion. Former Attorney General Bill Barr also backed this contention Wednesday in an interview with Fox News Digital, noting that after Trump takes office in January, prosecutors will be unable to continue the cases during his term. President Biden spoke by phone with Vice President Harris. He congratulated the Vice President on her historic campaign. President Biden also spoke by phone with President-elect Trump and congratulated him on his victory. President Biden expressed his commitment to ensuring a smooth transition and emphasized the importance of working to bring the country together. He also invited President-elect Trump to meet with him in the White House. The staff will coordinate a specific date in the near future. Tomorrow, President Biden will address the nation to discuss the election results and the transition. -- Fox News' Peter Doocy Ahead of Harris' concession speech, Harris and Trump spoke on the phone earlier today, former President Trump's campaign confirmed. 'President Donald J. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris spoke by phone earlier today where she congratulated him on his historic victory,' Steven Cheung, Trump Campaign Communications Director said in a statement to Fox News. 'President Trump acknowledged Vice President Harris on her strength, professionalism, and tenacity throughout the campaign, and both leaders agreed on the importance of unifying the country,' Cheung said. Democrats are growing increasingly concerned that they will narrowly lose the House of Representatives after Republican victories in the Senate and White House. The balance of power in the House is expected to run razor-thin no matter who wins, but sources who spoke with Fox News Digital are worried that the Democrats' path is narrowing.'We're almost certainly going to lose the House by a narrow margin,' a senior House Democratic aide told Fox News Digital. 'We got our a--es kicked.' The House aide found optimism, however, in Republicans' comparatively decisive victories in the upper chamber and presidential race. 'If you told me [President-elect Trump] won the popular vote, dominated the electoral college, and they could end up with 56 seats in the Senate, this House map is really not too bad,' they said. New York Attorney General Letitia James congratulated President-elect Donald Trump on his election victory but vowed the state would also be ready to fight against his administration. 'If possible, we will work with his administration. But we will not compromise our values or our integrity or our principles. We did not expect this result, but we are prepared to respond to this result,' James said. as a press conference on Wednesday. 'And my office has been preparing for several months because we've been here before. We faced this challenge before, and we use the rule of law to fight back. And we are prepared to fight back once again because as the Attorney general of this great state is my job to protect and defend the rights of New Yorkers and the rule of law. And I will not shrink from that responsibility.' The Fox News Decision Desk projects that Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., managed to survive a tough re-election battle, defeating her Republican opponent in the swing state. She overcame challenger Eric Hovde, a Republican businessman who sought to unseat her. He was notably endorsed by
20241107105813	former President Trump. Baldwin will now serve a third term in the upper chamber after first being elected in 2012. The race in Wisconsin was considered particularly competitive given the expectation that the state would also be decisive in the presidential election. With the steep decline in split-ticket voting, a Senate candidate would have a much greater chance at winning if the presidential candidate also took the state. The Fox News Power Rankings rated Wisconsin as a toss up in the presidential election as of mid-October. In late September, the Senate race was rated 'Leans Democrat.' Top political handicapper, the Cook Political Report, had similarly long held that the Wisconsin Senate race was in the 'Lean Democrat' category, but last month shifted its rating to a 'Toss up,' citing a closing polling gap between the candidates. A smiling Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., congratulated both President-elect Trump for his projected win and his fellow Senate Republicans for being projected to retake the majority in the new Congress. He told reporters on Wednesday, it is 'certainly a happy day for the GOP.' McConnell addressed the significance of the projected Trump win, remarking, 'What he's accomplished has not been done, as all of you know, since Grover Cleveland, which was a while back.' Former President Grover Cleveland was notably the only president to serve non-consecutive terms. 'I also want to commend the Trump campaign for running a sharper operation this time,' he added. Harris campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon sent a letter to all campaign staff on Wednesday, Fox News Digital has learned. The email stated: 'Just a few moments ago, the Vice President connected with President Trump to concede the race. In the call, she told him that she would work with President Biden to ensure a peaceful transfer of power, unlike what we saw in 2020. She also made clear that she hopes he will be a President for all Americans. I don't have words to express the gratitude I have for everyone getting this email. You left everything on the field. You built a first-rate, historic Presidential campaign in basically 90 days. You navigated things that no one has ever had to navigate, and likely no one will ever have to again. You stared down unprecedented headwinds and obstacles that were largely out of our control. We knew this would be a margin of error race, and it was. And, your work mattered: the whole country moved to the right, but compared to the rest of the country, the battleground states saw the least amount of movement in his direction. It was closest in the places we competed. That speaks to both the work you did, and the scale of the challenge we ultimately couldn't surmount.The Vice President will speak to the nation later today at Howard University. Immediately following the Vice President's speech, she and Governor Walz will host an all staff call to speak directly to you about what we accomplished in this short run and the road ahead for all of us. We hope you'll join us and we'll have a calendar invite shortly. I'll leave you with this: losing is unfathomably painful. It is hard. This will take a long time to process. But the work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump Presidency starts now. I know the Vice President isn't finished in this fight, and I know the very people on this email are also going to be leaders in this collective mission. View this as the beginning, not the end. It will be hard work. But as the boss says: hard work is good work. And I look forward to standing beside you.' A senior
20241107105814	aide for Kamala Harris tells Fox News that the vice president has called President-Elect Trump Wednesday to congratulate him on winning the 2024 race. During the call, Harris discussed the importance of peaceful transfer of power and serving as a president who represents all Americans, the aide said. Harris is expected to make public comments later this afternoon during a speech at Howard University in Washington, D.C. Fox News' Jacqui Heinrich contributed to this report.

2024110701271	Kamala Harris of the Democrat party has 67,951,111 votes (47.5%) Donald Trump of the Republican party has 72,658,972 votes (50.8%) Nearly a month ago, Kamala Harris appeared on ABC's The View in what was expected to be a friendly interview aimed at pitching herself to Americans who wanted to know more about her. But the sit-down was quickly overshadowed by her response to a question on what she would have done differently from incumbent president, Joe Biden: 'Not a thing comes to mind.' Harris's answer - which became a Republican attack ad on loop - underscored the political headwinds that her jumpstart campaign failed to overcome in her decisive loss to Donald Trump on Tuesday. Publicly, she conceded the race late on Wednesday afternoon, telling supporters 'do not despair'. But soul-searching over where she went wrong and what else she could have done will likely take longer as Democrats begin finger-pointing and raising questions about the future of the party. Harris campaign officials were silent in the early Wednesday hours while some aides expressed tearful shock over what they had expected to be a much closer race. 'Losing is unfathomably painful. It is hard,' Harris campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon said in an email to staff on Wednesday. 'This will take a long time to process.' As the sitting vice-president, Harris was unable to untether herself from an unpopular president and convince voters that she could offer the change they were seeking amid widespread economic anxiety. After Biden dropped out of the race following a disastrous debate performance, Harris was anointed to the top of the ticket, bypassing the scrutiny of a primary without a single vote being cast. She began her 100-day campaign promising a 'new generation of leadership', rallying women around abortion rights and vowing to win back working-class voters by focusing on economic issues including rising costs and housing affordability. With just three months until election day, she generated a wave of initial momentum, which included a flurry of memes on social media, a star-studded endorsement list that included Taylor Swift and a record-setting donation windfall. But Harris couldn't shake the anti-Biden sentiment that permeated much of the electorate. The president's approval rating has consistently hovered in the low 40s throughout his four years in office, while some two-thirds of voters say they believe the US is on the wrong track. Some allies have privately questioned whether Harris remained too loyal to Biden in her bid to replace him. But Jamal Simmons, the vice-president's former communication director, called it a 'trap', arguing any distance would have only handed Republicans another attack line for being disloyal. 'You can't really run away from the president who chooses you,' he said. Harris tried to walk the fine line of addressing the administration's record without casting shade on her boss, showing a reluctance to break with any of Biden's policies while also not outwardly promoting them on the campaign trail. But she then failed to deliver a convincing argument about why she should lead the country, and how she would handle economic frustrations as well as widespread concerns over immigration. About 3 in 10 voters said their family's financial situation was falling behind, an increase from about 2 in 10 four years ago, according to data from AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 US voters conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago. Nine in 10 voters were very or somewhat concerned about the price of groceries. The same survey found
2024110701272	that 4 in 10 voters said immigrants living in the US illegally should be deported to their country of origin, up from around 3 in 10 who said the same in 2020. And though Harris tried to spend the home stretch of her campaign underlining that her administration would not be a continuation of Biden's, she failed to clearly outline her own policies, often skirting around issues instead of addressing perceived failures head on. The Harris campaign had hoped to reassemble the voting base that powered Biden's 2020 victory, winning over the core Democratic constituencies of black, Latino and young voters as well as making further gains with college-educated suburban voters. But she underperformed with these key voting blocs. She lost 13 points with Latino voters, two points with black voters, and six points with voters under 30, according to exit polls, which may change as votes are counted, but are considered representative of trends. Independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who lost the 2016 Democratic presidential primary to Hillary Clinton and the 2020 primary to Biden, said in a statement it was 'no great surprise' that working class voters abandoned the party. 'First, it was the white working class, and now it is Latino and black workers as well. While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change,' he said. 'And they're right.' While women largely threw their support behind Harris over Trump, the vice-president's lead did not exceed the margins that her campaign had hoped her historic candidacy would turn out. And she was unable to deliver on her ambitions of winning over suburban Republican women, losing 53% of white women. In the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion, Democrats had hoped her focus on the fight for reproductive rights would deliver a decisive victory. While some 54% of female voters cast their ballots for Harris, it fell short of the 57% who backed Biden in 2020, according to exit poll data. Even before she was catapulted to the top of the ticket, Harris had sought to frame the race as a referendum on Trump, not Biden. The former California prosecutor leaned into her law enforcement record to prosecute the case against the former president. But her nascent campaign opted to ditch Biden's core argument that Trump posed an existential threat to democracy, prioritising a forward-looking 'joyful' message about protecting personal freedoms and preserving the middle class. In the final stretch, however, Harris made a tactical decision to again highlight the dangers of a second Trump presidency, calling the president a 'fascist' and campaigning with disaffected Republicans fed up with his rhetoric. After Trump's former White House Chief of Staff, John Kelly, told the New York Times that Trump spoke approvingly about Adolf Hitler, Harris delivered remarks outside her official residence describing the president as 'unhinged and unstable'. 'Kamala Harris lost this election when she pivoted to focus almost exclusively on attacking Donald Trump,' veteran Republican pollster Frank Luntz said on Tuesday night. 'Voters already know everything there is about Trump - but they still wanted to know more about Harris' plans for the first hour, first day, first month and first year of her administration.' 'It was a colossal failure for her campaign to shine the spotlight on Trump more than on Harris's own ideas,' he added. Ultimately, the winning coalition Harris needed to beat Trump never materialised, and voters'

2024110701211	Advertisement Supported by critic's notebook In her concession speech, Kamala Harris offered an image for a long fight. By Vanessa Friedman Vanessa Friedman has covered political image-making and its influences since Bush v. Gore, including Volodymyr Zelensky and his olive green T-shirt and the appearance (and reappearance) of the white pantsuit. Kamala Harris speaking at Howard University was to be an image for history: a record of the first female president, not to mention the first Black female president and the first president of South Asian descent, giving her victory speech. Instead, what turned out to be her concession speech became the coda to an unprecedented election; the end of one story, rather than the beginning of another. That did not mean that Ms. Harris was any less a pioneer, or a role model, in the moment. Even if what she was modeling was how to make over the public face of defeat. Standing before the red bricks and the white columns that provide the backdrop for Howard commencements, Ms. Harris wore a businesslike pantsuit in a muddy burgundy that read, through the screen, as almost purple (interpret that as you will). The jacket was buttoned, an American flag pin bright against one lapel, and the pants were cut with a bit of a flare at the calf. With it, she wore her usual pumps, pearl earrings and a satin blouse in the same eggplant shade, complete with a cravat, or ascot-like tie. If there was a telling detail, that was it. The cravat is a cousin of the floppy bow Ms. Harris has often worn at major public occasions - the one that seemed to symbolize both tradition and subversion, men's wear and a woman's place, and to acknowledge that despite the fact that she had never put gender at the center of her candidacy, it was there all the same. In the context of her concession speech, the cravat hearkened back to history - her own and that of the women and the politicians who came before her - and in that context, it represented, as she said in that speech, the idea that some fights were long. That this one had been going on for decades (even centuries) and would continue afterward. It was, in that way, a symbol of both a promise and a lament. The tie brought her full circle, connecting this appearance to her victory speech in 2020, when she became vice president; to her appearances at the Democratic National Convention, when she became her party's nominee for president; and to the debate, when she first went face to face with Donald J. Trump. If uniforms are part of what constitutes a signature and a shortcut to carving out a space in the popular imagination, she had created one all her own. Her clothes, subliminal though their effects may be, suggested that the imagery of her last moment as a presidential candidate in this election cycle had been as deliberately chosen as the words she spoke. That she knew fashion was a useful tool in crafting her abbreviated legacy because it was one that was widely understood. And she wielded it with intent - just as she indubitably would have had she won. Though in that scenario, while chances are the outfit would have spoken the same sartorial language, it might have been heightened: the suit more structured, the tie more frothy; redolent, as her look was during the debate, of presidents beforehand stretching all the way back to George Washington. After all, she did use clothing as one of her closing metaphors. It was, she told the audience assembled before her (some in tears), 'not a time to throw up our hands - it is a time to roll up our sleeves.' Her sleeves remained down.

2024110622391	It was supposed to be everything short of a free ad - a panel of women not containing their excitement to welcome Kamala Harris, ready to introduce her to their committed daytime audience of exactly the type of women the vice president's campaign always hoped were going to be critical to her base. It was a moment that encapsulated one of the biggest challenges facing her campaign - which, in the end, proved insurmountable. 'What, if anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?' co-host of ABC's 'The View' Sunny Hostin asked Harris, looking to give her a set for her to spike over the net. Related article Trump will win second term, CNN projects, in historic comeback after losing four years ago 'There is not a thing that comes to mind,' she said. Even Harris realized she had a problem, trying to adjust a moment later by saying she would put a Republican in her Cabinet. Aides didn't wait until Harris was off the set to start trying to clean it up. A Democrat who had spoken with her told CNN at the time that she didn't want to name her differences with President Joe Biden - including a higher capital gains tax rate, a bigger child tax credit and a tougher border policy - because she thought it would look disloyal to the man who had picked her as his running mate and then stepped aside for her. The thud fell in a campaign already struggling with a listless October, which had replaced the late summer exuberance and a September debate that nearly every political observer other than Donald Trump acknowledged she crushed. As aides new to the Harris orbit exerted control, she struggled with preparation. She grew hesitant, losing some of the confidence and swagger that had defined the early weeks of her reintroduction to the country. Aides who had successfully pushed her out of her comfort zone earlier in the year felt like they were running into the kind of walls she used to put up. CNN spoke with over a dozen senior Harris campaign aides both in the Wilmington, Delaware, campaign headquarters and on the ground in the states, as well as multiple volunteers and local elected officials, over the course of the final weeks of the race. A country crying out for change got a candidate who, at a crucial moment as more voters were tuning in, decided to soft-pedal the change she knew she represented. In the scope of a Democratic ticket that pulled off the biggest turnaround in approval ratings and the fastest consolidation around a new candidate in the history of modern presidential politics, this may have seemed like a minor moment. But it reflected deeper problems: some, like with the staff around her, that she might have been able to adjust; and one, with Biden, that she could never shake, with internal polls showing overwhelming majorities of voters thought the country was on the wrong track. By the time Harris got a clearer, sharper contrast answer out on the Biden question, the situation had congealed in ways she never got past - both among voters wavering in the center who wanted to hear her rebuff the president on his handling of the economy and voters on the left who wanted to hear her more forcefully disavow Biden's support for Israel. But perhaps the bigger problem with Biden, top Democrats fumed in the aftermath of that fateful debate in June and then again as they watched the results turn red on Tuesday, is that he should have never been anywhere near the 2024 race. If he had stepped aside after the midterms, as some aides urged him to, the Democratic Party process could have played
2024110622392	out in a primary campaign. Candidates' kinks could have been worked out - or not. Almost certainly whoever emerged as the nominee would have gone into the final weeks without so many Americans complaining they didn't know enough, as they said about Harris. Biden could have taken on a role as steward and elder statesman, rather than a guy the Harris campaign never knew quite what do with. If the election had been two weeks ago, senior aides to Harris were admitting in recent days, the vice president probably would have lost. But they went into Tuesday feeling like she had gotten herself to a likely squeaker victory. One-on-one conversations volunteers were having as they knocked on doors seemed to be clicking. For the first time in his nine years dominating American politics, Trump's character seemed to be breaking through as an actual weight on people who wanted to vote for him. Related article What happens to Trump's criminal and civil cases now that he's been reelected Leading Democrats smiled just thinking about what it would mean to beat Trump with the first female president - a woman of color, a child of two immigrants, a prosecutor, and a candidate who talked about joy and offered up her smile against the scowl that had become his most common expression. Her candidacy sparked in them the unfamiliar feeling of hope. That sentiment evaporated by 11 p.m. on Tuesday. But for many anxious Democrats, this is just the beginning. Going into Election Day, many top Democratic operatives across the campaign and in the states told CNN different versions of the same thought: If this didn't work - with the massive campaign they'd put together, with millions of doors knocked by volunteers who flooded into battleground states, with GOP former Rep. Liz Cheney and former President Bill Clinton united under the same tent stumping hard for her, with celebrities from Bad Bunny and Arnold Schwarzenegger throwing their cultural weight behind her - what will? 'I can't imagine, I can't even get my mind around what it would be like if Donald Trump won, because he is telling us such dark and sinister things that he's going to do, and I believe him,' Sen. Cory Booker told CNN after a campaign stop late Monday afternoon in Bucks County, Pennsylvania - one of the key swing districts in the crucial battleground state. The New Jersey Democrat said he had already warned his own staff about not giving up. 'We need to get up the next morning and forge forward,' Booker said. 'I told them how much I don't like hearing people say, 'Oh, if so-and-so wins, I'm going to go to Canada. That's just not our history. We've seen really bad outcomes out of bad historical events in our country, and we're here because of the resiliency, the toughness, the strength of our country - and people even in the worst of times dug in and tried to do the best for our country.' Harris' team would have gladly taken more time to introduce the vice president to the country, or to put together an operation, which, after the ticket switch in July, woke up every morning at campaign headquarters and in the states feeling behind on planning. But by the time the campaign pulled off its multi-state simultaneous rally across battleground states Monday evening - which ended with Lady Gaga singing her song 'The Edge of Glory' and adding in, 'I'm an American woman on the edge' on the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art - a nervous feeling of maybe having made a movement happen was spreading among Harris aides and top supporters. Those aides were a hodgepodge. Biden hadn't just struggled as a
2024110622393	candidate, but had failed to attract some top talent to his campaign because a generation of up-and-coming Democrats could never get excited about him. Harris tried to graft some of her own team onto them, even overlooking tensions between them from the early days of the Biden administration with campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon and keeping her in charge. Related article Here's what Trump is proposing for the economy But some of those who had been in Wilmington for a year before Harris became the candidate bucked at their new bosses. Alumni of Barack Obama - most prominently his 2008, campaign manager David Plouffe, but also many others who moved into state operations - tried to flex a sometimes dated but often more incisive sense of how to win voters. Along the way, multiple aides told CNN how much they were grinding on one another. But the mission to beat Trump and the short timeline to try to get there helped paper over a lot of the infighting that might have exploded in a longer campaign. It instead just raged behind the scenes as aides like Stephanie Cutter moved to exert dominance over defining how and what Harris said what she said. And those tensions manifested from almost the start of this short campaign, in the internal wrangling over who Harris should pick as her running mate. The case for Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro was strong, and not just because Harris' brother-in-law Tony West was telling her they looked like the future of the Democratic Party together, and that the popular governor would make sure she won Pennsylvania. Right-wing media types weren't the only ones who noticed how much Shapiro had made himself into an Obama clone, as much a Jewish guy from the Philadelphia suburbs could be: The Obama alumni suddenly rushing onto her campaign were pushing for Shapiro. Harris liked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, though. She liked his line about Republicans being weird. She liked the way he came off as easy and unassuming. She liked the way they'd gotten along in their interview, including his very open stress that he would mess up in a debate with Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. And she liked the way Walz had been so deferential to however she would define the job for him. In the end, Harris made a decision that simultaneously reflected her newfound confidence and her long-standing insecurity, solid with trusting her own instincts, fine with going against her family and against the Obama orbit, but also with no interest in having anyone who would possibly outshine her. Then, as top aides kept Harris away from interviews and unscripted moments for weeks longer than many on the campaign thought made sense, Walz was necessarily kept in a box too, so that he didn't come off more accessible than she was. Tuesday morning, outside a canvas launch in northeast Philadelphia, Shapiro deflected a question about whether Pennsylvania - and the race - would have looked different had he been the choice. 'I think she made a great pick in Tim Walz,' he said. Biden, most Democrats were confident going into Tuesday, would have never even been in contention. The president watched the results come in from the White House, making a few calls to local winning candidates back in Delaware. Some who spoke with him as he made the decision to drop out in July briefly lingered on what might have been - maybe he could have won by keeping his numbers even in counties where he ended up outperforming Harris, or if he'd lost anyway, at least it wouldn't have put the burden on a Black woman.

She convinced a party full of insiders who had gone into the year ready to write her off for the 2028 Democratic nomination that they should go all in on her for 2024. At the beginning of the night Tuesday, when victory seemed just hours away, the people who came to what was supposed to be Harris' celebration were dancing. A Howard University graduate seemed about to walk into history in the heart of her old HBCU campus. At one point, the camera found the student body president in the crowd and she blushed as she saw herself projected on the big screen. Anticipation mounted and cheers went out with every state called for Harris. Seconds after North Carolina was called for Trump, the audio was switched off the big screens and music blasted through the speakers to try to salvage the energy. Most kept staring silently at the numbers, trying to make sense of what had happened. In state capitals with Democratic governors, break-glass plans that they had started to believe they would never need are getting yanked off the shelves - to protect access to abortion medications, but also to work up other protections from what they believe will be not just a stringent, but vindictive, administration. Early thoughts about who will be running and how in 2028 are starting to circulate. That was not on the minds of the people who started streaming out of the Howard campus early Wednesday before campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond had even finished telling them that there was still counting to be done. 'We try to do it right, we try to be good Christians,' one woman said to the man walking with her. 'We've got to take a page out of their book.' 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

2024110622051	A shift away from pro-Israel Democrats in communities like Dearborn underscores anger over war in Gaza and Lebanon. Save articles to read later and create your own reading list. Dearborn, Michigan - When Fox News called Pennsylvania for Donald Trump in the early hours of Wednesday, all but confirming that he would be the next president of the United States, there were a handful of Arab activists left at a watch party in Dearborn, Michigan. 'Genocide is bad politics,' said one attendee at the event, which had Palestinian and Lebanese flags hanging outside its doors. As the reality of another Trump presidency set off anger and sorrow from many Democratic commentators, at the Arab American gathering there was a sense of indifference - if not vindication. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris had ignored the community's calls for reconsidering the unconditional US support for Israel. The vice president also continued to assert what she calls 'Israel's right to defend itself' despite the brutal atrocities in Gaza and Lebanon. Activist Adam Abusalah said part of the reason why Harris lost was her decision to side with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the expense of alienating the Democratic base - Arab and Muslim Americans as well as young people and progressives. 'It's not our fault. They cannot vilify our community,' Abusalah said. 'We've been warning the Democrats for over a year now, and the Democrats continue to downplay what's going on.' He added that Harris's main message to the Arab community was to warn of the dangers of a Trump presidency. This tactic failed to work as voters in the area were laser-focused on the continuing war in the Middle East that affected many of them personally. In the Arab-majority suburb of Dearborn, anger over Israel's US-backed assault on Gaza and Lebanon was tangible at the ballot box. Harris lost the city to Trump by more than 2,600 votes. President Joe Biden beat Trump by more than 17,400 votes - a more than 20,000-vote swing that helped the Republican former president reclaim Michigan. Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, who centred opposition to the war in her platform, also performed relatively well in the city, growing her party's support from 207 votes in 2020 to more than 7,600 this year. Hussein Dabajeh, a Lebanese American political consultant in the Detroit area, noted that Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, a Democrat, significantly outperformed Harris in Dearborn, receiving more than 9,600 votes than the vice president. 'The Arab community said we're anti-genocide. We supported the candidates that supported the community, and we stood against the candidates that stood against the community,' Dabajeh told Al Jazeera. It is unclear what a Trump presidency will mean for Arab and Muslim Americans and the country at large. 'I hope it's something good. I hope the country comes together. I hope the Democrats are brought to their senses,' Dabajeh said. While the former president has a long history of anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant statements and policies, he has promised to bring 'peace' to the region. Trump also softened his antagonistic tone towards Arabs and Muslims as he courted their communities in Michigan. He brought Arab and Muslim officials and imams to the stage during his rallies and called them 'great people'. Trump also visited Dearborn and listened first-hand to demands to end the war, which Harris failed to do. Ali Alfarjalla, a 32-year-old Iraqi American real estate agent in Dearborn, said that for all his flaws, Trump represents a change from the
2024110622052	Biden-Harris administration that has been unflinchingly supporting the Israeli assault on Gaza and Lebanon. He stressed that the election is not the end of political engagement, saying that the community will press Trump to deliver on his promise of bringing peace to the region. 'It doesn't stop here,' Alfarjalla told Al Jazeera. 'We have to work more to make sure our issues are heard - to stop the genocide in Gaza, stop the invasion of south Lebanon, and let Palestine have its own state. We're hopeful about that. That's our number one priority for this community.' He also said that Harris supporters' 'lesser of two evils' pitch to the community backfired because many voters could not see a worse evil than the administration providing the bombs that were killing their families and destroying their hometowns. While both major candidates back Israel, the Harris campaign committed a series of unforced errors that further alienated the community in Michigan and beyond, Arab American advocates told Al Jazeera. At the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August, the Harris campaign rejected demands to allow a speech by a Palestinian speaker. The Democratic candidate also turned down a request for a meeting by the Uncommitted Movement, which was founded during the Democratic Primary process to pressure Biden over his unconditional support for Israel. Unlike Trump, Harris did not visit Dearborn, the de-facto seat of Arab American political and financial power, during her campaign. Instead, Harris met with handpicked Arab and Muslim 'leaders' in Flint, about an hour north of Detroit, last month. Moreover, Harris campaigned with Liz Cheney in Michigan and welcomed the endorsement of her father, former President Dick Cheney - an architect of the so-called 'War on Terror' that devastated the Middle East. Numerous Arab American activists invoked Harris's embrace of the Cheneys when underscoring her apparent disregard for their communities. 'We had Harris endorsed by neoconservatives like Liz Cheney and Dick Cheney, and she's openly campaigning with them and talking about how great they are,' Dearborn councilman Mustapha Hammoud told Al Jazeera on Tuesday night as the results trickled in. 'You know what? I don't think people are willing to vote for George W Bush, so you weren't going to see people vote for Harris, either.' Speaking under a Harris campaign sign last week, former President Bill Clinton claimed that Hamas 'forces' Israel to kill Palestinian civilians and suggested that Zionism pre-dates Islam. The campaign's behaviour led some advocates to question whether the Democratic candidate has given up on the Arab community. 'Vice President Harris has shown over and over again that she actually doesn't want our vote,' Uncommitted Movement leader Layla Elabed told Al Jazeera last week. Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud also noted that the Harris campaign was hesitant to engage Arab Americans directly. 'They don't want the heckling to occur. They don't want to knock on the doors where they think the conversations are going to drag, and the votes might not be there,' the mayor told Al Jazeera before the elections. On the policy front, Harris did not make any concrete promises to the community - even within the acceptable realm of mainstream politics - like reopening the Palestinian diplomatic mission in Washington, DC, or resuming funding for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA). In contrast, Biden released platforms for Arab and Muslim Americans in 2020, promising domestic and foreign policy moves sought by the community - many
2024110622053	of which went unfulfilled. Bottom line, many Arab Americans say they already survived four years of Trump while many of their relatives in Palestine and Lebanon did not survive the Biden-Harris presidency. They say they will continue to push for change, no matter who is in power. Asked about some liberal social media users attacking Arab Americans and blaming them for Harris's defeat, Alfarjalla said many people in the community have survived war and adversity, so they are not concerned about what others say. 'I smile and laugh at it,' he said. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Vice President Kamala Harris told supporters gathered at Howard University on Wednesday that she had lost the 2024 Election to Donald Trump, conceding to the Republican President-elect after a hard fought campaign. Here's what to know: Siga la cobertura de las elecciones de AP en espanol Watch live as Kamala Harris delivers her concession speech after Donald Trump was elected the 47th president of the United States. AP estimated late Wednesday evening that there are more than 200,000 ballots left to count in Nevada - including more than 130,000 in Clark County. Given the narrow margins in the races for president and U.S. Senate, both are too early to call. The AP will further review results released by Nevada election officials on Thursday. Officials in Arizona's Maricopa County said late Wednesday they've got more than 700,000 ballots left to count, which means races for president and U.S. Senate in the state will remain too early to call for another day. In all, AP estimates there are at least a million ballots to be added to the results in Arizona. County election officials are expected to firm up those numbers on Thursday. The FBI is warning of additional fabricated videos that misuse its name and insignia to undermine confidence in the electoral system. One of the videos falsely claims that the FBI was made aware that at least 301 electors reported attempted bribery and blackmail by a political party. Another video falsely claims that the FBI is investigating voter pressure at US military bases overseas, a third claims that a U.S. social media company has seen an increase in the number of separatist groups to include a total audience of more than 40 million people and the fourth falsely claims that the FBI has ordered media to restrict the spread of information about the bribery of electors. The FBI says each of the videos contains false information. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has congratulated Trump on his 'huge win' and discussed strengthening security and economic cooperation between the allies, according to a Seoul presidential official. Kim Tae-hyo, Yoon's deputy national security director, said Thursday that Yoon and Trump also discussed the growing threats posed by nuclear-armed North Korea, including its intercontinental ballistic missiles targeting the U.S. mainland, and its reported provision of troops to Russia in support of Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine. Kim said Trump called for expanding the countries' cooperation in the shipbuilding industries, highlighting South Korea's strengths in building warships and vessels, and called for more detailed discussions on improving U.S. competitiveness in ship exports as well as maintenance and repair. Kim said Yoon and Trump agreed to arrange an in-person meeting soon. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office said Trudeau congratulated Trump in a phone call. 'The two leaders discussed the enduring and successful partnership between Canada and the United States,' the statement said. The statement noted that they discussed trade, supply chains, global trading practices and North American security. CLAIM: President Joe Biden won approximately 20 million more votes in the 2020 election than Vice President Kamala Harris earned in the 2024 race, proving either that Trump has cheated his way to a second term or that there was widespread fraud four years ago. THE FACTS:
2024110703102	The claims are unfounded. Votes from Tuesday's presidential election are still being counted, so any comparison with previous races would not be accurate. In addition, election officials and agencies monitoring the vote have reported no significant issues with Tuesday's election. Claims of widespread fraud in 2020 have been debunked countless times. Read more about the false claim President Biden will address the nation Thursday at 11 a.m. EST. The remarks to the nation will be Biden's first appearance on camera in the aftermath of Donald Trump's decisive victory over Kamala Harris. Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr spoke about the election ahead of a game against the Boston Celtics. In August, he coached the U.S. Olympics men's team to a gold medal in Paris. 'Well, I believe in democracy, and I think the American people have spoken and voted for Trump, and I want him to do well the next four years. I want our country to do well.' 'It's a complex world. We've got a lot of interesting stuff between wars abroad, a global economy that has shifted everything in terms of what it means for our citizens and their day-to-day lives,' he said. 'I want what's best for us. I hope Trump can deliver.' Donald Trump ran a campaign centered on hypermasculinity, actively courting young men in particular with interviews on popular male-centric podcasts. In the closing weeks of the campaign, the former president and many of his surrogates leaned into sexist remarks and jokes about Vice President Kamala Harris. Some of his supporters, including former presidential rival Nikki Haley, warned that the former president risked exacerbating his persistent gender gap with Harris. Prominent surrogates from billionaire Elon Musk to Charlie Kirk, founder of the conservative youth organization Turning Point, called on men to vote in large numbers to counter Harris' expected strength among women. In the end, the gender voting gap was unremarkable by recent historical standards. Read more takeaways from AP VoteCast Trump has already appointed three Supreme Court justices. In his second term, he could well have a chance to name two more, creating a high court with a Trump-appointed majority that could serve for decades. The decisive outcome spares the court from having to wade into election disputes. It also seems likely to change the tenor of cases that come before the justices, including on abortion and immigration. The two eldest justices - Clarence Thomas, 76, and Samuel Alito, 74 - could consider stepping down knowing that Trump, a Republican, would nominate replacements who might be three decades younger and ensure conservative domination of the court through the middle of the century, or beyond. Read more about how Trump could further shape the Supreme Court Former President Bill Clinton and former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton wished Trump and running mate JD Vance well on Wednesday, writing that they 'hope they will govern for all of us.' The Clintons had been some of the most outspoken Democratic critics of Trump. The former Democratic president stumped across the country for Harris and running mate Tim Walz, while the former secretary of state, Trump's opponent in 2016, had criticized her one-time rival throughout the entire election. The two commended Harris and Walz for running 'a positive, forward-looking campaign to be proud of.' 'We must remember that America is bigger than the results of any one election, and what we as citizens do now will make the difference between a nation that moves forward and one that falls back,' they
2024110703103	wrote. 'We need to solve our problems and see our opportunities together. The future of our country depends on it.' Trump's campaign says he has accepted President Biden's invitation to meet at the White House to discuss the presidential transition. No date has been announced yet but Steven Cheung, Trump's communications director, said it would 'take place shortly.' Cheung said Trump 'very much appreciated' Biden's congratulatory call on Wednesday. Biden, in a White House-issued statement, praised Harris as 'a tremendous partner and public servant full of integrity, courage, and character.' It was Biden's first public comment in the aftermath of Trump's victory. The president also noted that Harris entered the campaign under 'extraordinary circumstances,' a nod to his dropping out of the race 108 days before Election Day amid growing pressure from within his party after his cataclysmic debate performance against Trump. Biden added that Harris 'stepped up and led a historic campaign that embodied what's possible when guided by a strong moral compass and a clear vision for a nation that is more free, more just, and full of more opportunities for all Americans.' A disaffected electorate wanted former President Donald Trump to return to the White House, a blatant rejection of Vice President Kamala Harris and her nearly four years with President Joe Biden. The Republican's victory came from a public so put off by America's trajectory that they welcomed his brash and disruptive approach. About 3 in 10 voters said they wanted total upheaval in how the country is run, according to AP VoteCast, a sweeping survey of more than 120,000 voters nationwide. Even if they weren't looking for something that dramatic, more than half of voters overall said they wanted to see substantial change. Both nationwide and in key battleground states, the Republicans won over voters who were alarmed about the economy and prioritized more aggressive enforcement of immigration laws. Those issues largely overshadowed many voters' focus on the future of democracy and abortion protections - key priorities for Harris' voters, but not enough to turn the election in her favor. Learn how this key issue shaped the election Minnesota Gov.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) As Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz was leaving after his running mate's concession speech, a reporter asked him: 'What's next?' 'Minnesota,' he answered. Melania Trump marked her husband's win in the 2025 election by saying a 'majority of Americans have entrusted us with this important responsibility.' The former - and future - first lady was an infrequent figure on the campaign trail with the Republican candidate. Melania Trump attended but did not speak at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. She did appear at Donald Trump's election party early on Wednesday morning. 'We will safeguard the heart of our republic - freedom,' Melania Trump wrote. 'I anticipate the citizens of our nation rejoining in commitment to each other and rising above ideology for the sake of individual liberty, economic prosperity, and security.' For all the concerns about a tumultuous process that could leave Americans waiting for days to learn who its next president would be, news outlets instead experienced an election night that hewed close to tradition. Fox News Channel declared Trump had reclaimed the presidency at 1:47 a.m. on Wednesday.
2024110703104	Broadcast networks and The Associated Press had Trump on the precipice of returning to the presidency when he took the stage in Florida at 2:25 a.m. to declare victory. Many journalists warned viewers that determining the winner could be a protracted process that could take several days like it had in 2020. Yet from the first hints provided by exit poll results shortly after 5 p.m. EST, the election night story moved methodically in Trump's direction. Read more about how the media covered election night Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement late Wednesday, saying that 'we all pray for America's success under the next administration,' but did not make mention of Trump by name. Pelosi was seen as the architect of the Democratic party's strategic shift from Joe Biden to Kamala Harris as top of their ticket over the summer. The California Democrat has been Trump's biggest critic, saying previously that her goal is to ensure Trump never enters the White House again. 'The peaceful transfer of power is the cornerstone of our democracy,' Pelosi said. 'After every election, we all have a responsibility to come together and find common ground.' Former Vice President Mike Pence congratulated Trump for winning a second term in office, writing yet another awkward chapter in the relationship between the president-elect and his former running mate. 'The American people have spoken and Karen and I send our sincere congratulations to President-Elect Donald Trump and his family on his election as 47th President of the United States,' Pence wrote on behalf of him and his wife. The former vice president also congratulated Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who ran in place of Pence as Trump's running mate. 'We will continue to pray for all those in authority and urge every American to join us in praying for our incoming President, Vice President and elected officials at every level,' Pence concluded. Pence's relationship with Trump fractured after the former vice president declined to follow the Republican president's wishes and went ahead with certifying the 2020 election. Trump did not hold back in his contempt for Pence, questioning his judgment and calling him 'delusional' on the campaign trail. Pence, in turn, declined to endorse his one-time running mate. Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump arrives at an election night watch party at the Palm Beach Convention Center, Wednesday, Nov. 6, 2024, in West Palm Beach, Fla. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) American presidential elections are a moment when the nation holds up a mirror to look at itself. They are a reflection of values and dreams, of grievances and scores to be settled. The results say much about a country's character, future and core beliefs. On Tuesday, America looked into that mirror and more voters saw former president Donald Trump, delivering him a far-reaching victory in the most contested states. He won for many reasons. One of them was that a formidable number of Americans, from different angles, said the state of democracy was a prime concern. Even as Trump prevailed, most voters said they were very or somewhat concerned that electing Trump would bring the U.S. closer to being an authoritarian country, where a single leader has unchecked power, according to the AP VoteCast survey. Still, 1 in 10 of those voters backed him anyway. Nearly 4 in 10 Trump voters said they wanted complete upheaval in how the country is run. Read more about Trump's plans for American democracy They're called swing states for a reason. On Tuesday, Trump led the Republican ticket to a
2024110703105	sweeping national victory. He was on track to improve upon his 2020 vote performance in 48 states. This included bringing back into the fold the five states that had abandoned him for Democratic Joe Biden four years ago. Six of the seven 2024 presidential battlegrounds that helped decide Tuesday's election had all moved sharply away from Trump in 2020. They included Georgia and Arizona, which hadn't supported a Democrat for president in more than 20 years, as well as North Carolina, which shifted sharply to the left but barely remained in Trump's column in 2020. Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin all supported Trump in 2016 after supporting Democratic presidential candidates for at least six consecutive elections but swung back toward Democrats in 2020. This year, Trump significantly outperformed his 2020 showing in all battlegrounds and had either won or was leading in the vote in the count as of Wednesday afternoon. Nevada maintained a 2.4 percentage-point advantage for the Democratic candidate in both 2016 and 2020. But Trump led by almost 5 percentage points on Wednesday, although the AP had not yet called the race. The election of Donald Trump as president for a second time and the Republican takeback of the U.S. Senate could undo many of the national climate policies that are most reducing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to climate solutions experts. When they list measures that are making the most difference, it lines up with policies Trump has said he'll target. These rollbacks will come as more lives are being lost in heat waves, record amounts of climate pollution are accumulating in the atmosphere, the United States has been hit with what may be two of its most expensive hurricanes, and nations, which will meet in Baku, Azerbaijan next week for climate negotiations, have failed to take strong action to change these realities. Read about some of the measures In a statement issued Wednesday, former President Barack Obama, along with former first lady Michelle Obama, said the election's result 'is obviously not the outcome we had hoped for' but noted that 'living in a democracy is about recognizing that our point of view won't always win out, and being willing to accept the peaceful transfer of power.' Congratulating Trump and Vance, the Obamas expressed pride for Harris and Walz, for both of whom they campaigned, calling them 'two extraordinary public servants who ran a remarkable campaign.' The Obamas cast forward with hope for a divided America, saying that the nation's problems are solvable 'only if we listen to each other, and only if we abide by the core constitutional principles and democratic norms that made this country great.' The White House is encouraging Trump to enter into the required agreements necessary to begin an orderly presidential transition. Trump's transition team still has not signed the agreements with the White House and the General Services Administration that allow them access to federal facilities, documents and personnel. The delay is holding up the federal government's ability to begin processing security clearances for potential Trump administration national security appointees, potentially limiting the number of his staff who could work on sensitive information by Inauguration Day. White House chief of staff Jeff Zients reached out to co-chairs Howard Lutnick and Linda McMahon to reiterate the role the agreements play in beginning a presidential transition, according to a White House official. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive
2024110703106	transition planning. Shortly after Harris' concession speech, a series of Democratic lawmakers issued their first statements in response to the election results and promised to ensure a 'peaceful' transition for the incoming Republican administration. 'As deeply, deeply disappointed as I am by the results of the election, make no mistake: my Democratic colleagues and I - unlike many Republicans after the 2020 election - will uphold the will of the American people, fulfill our constitutional duty and do our part to ensure a peaceful transfer of power,' Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois said in a statement. Transition talks have not yet begun in earnest, according to a person with knowledge of the Trump campaign. Instead, the president-elect was busy taking calls from leaders, domestic and international, donors and key supporters. Transition discussions are expected to ramp up later in the week, as attention turns to naming an inaugural committee and formal transition team. The person was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Nevada resumed counting votes on Wednesday afternoon, adding almost 21,000 votes including 9,000 from Clark County. Trump's lead in the state is about 560,000 votes, and the race is too early to call. Clark, home to Las Vegas, has the greatest number of ballots left to be counted. Election officials in Clark plan for another update late Wednesday and to update daily at 11 p.m. EST through Saturday.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) Democrats spent billions of dollars warning American voters that Donald Trump posed an imminent threat to democracy, that his economic policies would benefit only his wealthy friends, that he was literally a fascist. In the end, voters didn't care - or if they did, it didn't matter. And now, after Kamala Harris' decisive loss, Democrats enter a second Trump presidency with no clear leader, no clear plan and no agreement on what caused them to be so wrong about the 2024 election. 'I think there needs to be a cleaning of the house, there needs to be a new generation of leaders that emerge,' said Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., among the few Democrats with presidential ambitions to address the party's future on Wednesday. 'There needs to be new thinking, new ideas and a new direction. And, you know, the establishment produced a disaster.' Read more about the Democrats' future Former President Donald Trump won Alaska and its three electoral votes on Wednesday, adding to his lead in the Electoral College. Trump continues a decadeslong trend of Republicans carrying the state in the presidential race. When discussing Alaska, he has often cited his role while president in the passage of a 2017 tax law that called for oil and gas leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Trump endorsed in Alaska's other high-profile race this election cycle, backing Republican Nick Begich for U.S. House. The Associated Press declared Trump the winner at 4:59 p.m. EST. More than 70 national, state and local LGBTQ+ rights and advocacy organizations released a 'solidarity statement' Wednesday reacting to the results of this week's elections. 'Election outcomes at national, state, and local levels will impact our health, our safety, and our rights as LGBTQIA2S+ people and families,' the statement read. 'Despite anti-LGBTQIA2S+ efforts to divide our communities, and particularly severe attacks against transgender people and LGBTQIA2S+ youth, we have succeeded in moving a few steps closer toward equity and justice for our community.' The letter highlighted the reelection of lesbian U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and the election of the first transgender member of Congress, Rep.-elect Sarah McBride, of Delaware. The statement did not mention Trump by name. But he and other Republican candidates frequently employed anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric in campaign ads, remarks and platforms, particularly against transgender and nonbinary people. The statement was signed by groups including the National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, GLAAD, many PFLAG and Equality chapters, the Transgender Law Center, Advocates for Trans Equality, and the Trevor Project, a youth suicide prevention organization. Jaymes Black, CEO of
2024110703108	the Trevor Project, said separately in an email that volume on its crisis line from LGBTQ+ youths seeking help increased about 125% on Election Day through midday Wednesday.

'I know many people feel like we are entering a dark time, but for the benefit of us all, I hope that is not the case,' she said. 'America, if it is, let us fill the sky with the light of a brilliant, billion stars. The light of optimism, of faith, of truth and service.'

'We will continue to wage this fight in the voting booth, in the courts and in the public square,' Harris said, a nod to the work Democrats are poised to do in the next four years. Harris specifically called out the young people she sought to organize, acknowledging the loss may hurt but that the work is not over. 'Sometimes the fight takes a while. That doesn't mean we won't win. The important thing is don't ever give up,' she said. 'Don't ever stop trying to make the world a better place.'

'While I concede this election,' she said, 'I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign.' 'I will never give up a fight for a future where Americans can pursue their dreams ambitions and aspirations,' she said. America, she added, 'will never give up the fight for our democracy.'

'Folks are feeling and experiencing a range of emotions right now, I get it. But we must accept the results of this election,' she said. 'Earlier today I spoke with President-elect Trump and congratulated him on his victory,' Harris said to a smattering of boos from the audience. 'I also told him that we will help him and his team with their transition and that we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power.'

'The outcome of this election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for,' Harris said. 'But hear me when I say, the light of America's promise will always burn bright, as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting.' Harris had planned to address an audience like this at Howard on election night and had hoped she would have a more upbeat message to deliver.

Ahead of her walk on to Beyonce's 'Freedom,' a mix included Jeezy's 'My President,' which includes the lyric, 'My president is Black.' Arizona's biggest county, Maricopa, says it will update its vote count this evening, sometime around 8 p.m. EST. Trump leads Harris by more than 4 points with about 60% of the expected vote counted. The newest votes will be mailed ballots that arrived or were dropped off on Election Day or shortly before. It's not clear which candidate those will favor. Democrat Kamala Harris earned a statewide win in Maine, collecting a pair of electoral votes on Wednesday. Maine is one of two states that divide their electoral votes with two votes going to the statewide winner and one vote apiece to the winner of each congressional district. The last time a Republican won the statewide vote in Maine was in 1988, when Republican George W. Bush defeated Democrat Michael Dukakis. The Associated Press declared Harris the statewide winner at 4:23 p.m. EST. Harris' campaign chair acknowledged the Democrat's 'unfathomably painful' loss in a memo to staff, but told the operatives who worked for the vice president that 'the work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump Presidency starts now.' Jen O'Malley Dillon's memo to staff acknowledged the pain of the moment for Democrats but took a hopeful tone about the work these staffers have done. 'Losing is unfathomably painful. It is hard. This will take a long time to process,' she wrote. 'But the work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump Presidency starts now.' O'Malley Dillon said Harris 'isn't finished in this fight' and said the staffers who worked for the vice president are 'going to be leaders in this collective mission.' 'View this as the beginning, not the end' she concluded. 'It will be hard work. But as the boss says: hard work is good work.' Beyonce's 'Freedom' became a mainstay of Harris' presidential campaign,

Harris' presidential campaign took on Beyonce's 2016 track 'Freedom' as its anthem, with Harris walking out to it at dozens of events, including her acceptance speech at this summer's Democratic National Convention. The singer appeared with Harris last month during a campaign rally in her hometown of Houston, bringing a high level of star power to what had become a key theme of the Democratic nominee's bid: freedom.

Voters in Missouri cleared the way to undo one of the nation's most restrictive abortion bans in one of seven victories for abortion rights advocates, while Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota defeated similar constitutional amendments, leaving bans in place. Abortion rights amendments also passed in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana. Nevada voters also approved an amendment, but they'll need to pass it again it 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans discrimination on the basis of 'pregnancy outcomes' prevailed in New York. The results came in the same election where Trump won the presidency. Among his inconsistent positions on abortion has been an insistence that it's an issue best left to the states. Still, the president can have a major impact on abortion policy through executive action.

Trump's agenda also would scale back federal government efforts on civil rights and expand presidential powers.

2024110623411	The Vermont independent called the Democratic Party's campaign 'disastrous.' Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders issued a scathing statement on what he called the Democratic Party's 'disastrous' campaign after Vice President Kamala Harris lost the presidential election to former President Donald Trump. The independent, who caucuses with Democrats, said it 'should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them.' 'First, it was the white working class, and now it is Latino and Black workers as well,' Sanders continued in his statement. 'While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change. And they're right.' The longtime progressive champion, who ran for president in 2016 and 2020, reflected on the ways Americans continue to experience economic instability, from income and wealth inequality to a lack of guaranteed paid family and medical leave. Sanders also criticized continued spending on military aid to Israel. 'Today, despite strong opposition from a majority of Americans, we continue to spend billions funding the extremist Netanyahu government's all out war against the Palestinian people which has led to the horrific humanitarian disaster of mass malnutrition and the starvation of thousands of children,' Sanders said. Sanders, who won reelection Tuesday to a fourth six-year term in the U.S. Senate, cast doubt about the party's ability to learn its lesson. 'Will the big money interests and well-paid consultants who control the Democratic Party learn any real lessons from this disastrous campaign? Will they understand the pain and political alienation that tens of millions of Americans are experiencing? Do they have any ideas as to how we can take on the increasingly powerful Oligarchy which has so much economic and political power? Probably not,' Sanders said. Sanders said 'very serious political discussions' are now merited about the path forward for 'those of us concerned about grassroots democracy and economic justice,' before ending his statement with, 'Stay tuned.' Harris conceded the election in a speech on Wednesday at her alma mater, Howard University, in Washington, D.C. 'While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign,' she said. 'The fight for freedom, for opportunity, for fairness and the dignity of all people -- a fight for the ideals at the heart of our nation -- the ideals that reflect America at our best.' Harris' concession speech came after Trump was projected to win the swing states of Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

RMIT University provides funding as a strategic partner of The Conversation AU. View all partners On the Saturday before Election Day, I travelled from Washington DC to Charlotte, North Carolina, to attend one of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris' last campaign rallies. It was extraordinary how many women were in the crowd - young Black women in particular. There were also older, suburban, white women who looked like they could have been Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren's sister or cousin. There were many men, who were just as enthusiastic. But they were far outnumbered by the women. Harris was warm and charismatic, and the women in the crowd had such a huge reaction to her. They saved their biggest cheers for her lines about reproductive rights - North Carolina has very strict abortion restrictions, which are affecting women across the state. Overall, though, I got a sense of cautious optimism from the crowd. There was absolutely no complacency. People were very nervous and anxious about the impending election against Donald Trump, especially since North Carolina was one of the seven key battleground states. You could sense a kind of distrust in the broader American electorate. One of the focal points of Harris' campaign was her outreach to women voters. She made this election about freedom for women to make decisions about their own bodies and reproductive health. And while this message did resonate with many women - in particular younger women - it didn't with others. According to exit polls by the Associated Press, 47% of women over the age of 45 voted for Trump, as well as 43% of women aged 18-44. More than half of white women overall also voted for Trump (53%). Exit polls by CNN also found that while Harris did better than Hillary Clinton in 2016 with white women with college degrees, white women without degrees overwhelmingly supported Trump. This says a lot about the decisions that some women made in the election. It seems possible that what Trump was able to do was give these women enough wiggle room to reconcile what might seem to be otherwise irreconcilable. For instance, they could perhaps believe that Trump wouldn't actually implement a national abortion ban, simply because he has said he would not. Or they may simply believe that Trump's policies wouldn't necessarily apply to them. I think this led to some potentially cynical decision-making among voters, much as there was in 2016. And as expected, Harris also did worse than Trump among men. At least some of this - alongside the voting patterns of white women - comes down to structural racism and misogyny and the toxic mix of the two. Trump's entire campaign was structured around appealing to men and mobilising them to vote, in particular younger men. There was clearly a level of discomfort among men with the idea of a woman president. And there'll be a lot of recriminations about Harris' inability to appeal to those men, even though she had an entire event devoted to 'white dudes' and put forth an economic plan specifically for Black men. I think she did run an effective campaign overall, judging it on the basis of campaign tactics, but the underlying structures and divisions of American politics were hard to overcome. Trump didn't create these divisions, but he exploits them like no one else can. This is also partly because the Democrats -
2024110701332	even Harris' campaign - seemed either unwilling or unable to really address these structural divisions, economic inequality and their own role in the greatly changed economy in the US, dating back to the decisions of the Clinton administration in the 1990s. Harris also had to walk this impossible line in attempting to be the 'change candidate' while not disavowing the Biden administration. There's been a lot of attention in the US media today about a moment in early October on The View, a popular talk show, in which Harris was asked what she would have done differently than Biden over the last four years, if given the chance. And she said nothing came to mind. It's entirely possible the Democrats will take the wrong lesson out of this campaign. There are recriminations already coming from the right of the party that Harris had moved too far to the left and should have spent more time trying to appeal to Republican voters in states like Pennsylvania. But I think you could make the opposite argument - that the Democrats failed to listen to their base in places like Michigan, where there was so much anger for the Biden administration's support for Israel in its war on Gaza. In the Democratic primaries earlier this year, for instance, some 100,000 people in Michigan voted 'uncommitted' instead of for Biden. And when you consider the fact that Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian representative in Congress, was re-elected with a huge majority in Michigan, as was Representative Ilhan Omar in Minnesota, this suggests Harris' campaign did not mobilise the base in the way that it needed to. They didn't listen to what the base was telling them. The Democrats need to look now at offering real structural economic change that addresses inequality and a reassessment of the US role in the world. They can't underestimate the appeal of Trump's line about Russia's invasion of Ukraine, for instance - that this wouldn't have happened under a Trump presidency. Many Americans are exhausted with American-led wars or American involvement in wars overseas - and I think that's another thing the Harris campaign and Biden administration were either unable or unwilling to hear that.

2024110617461	OpinionTressie McMillan Cottom Credit...Damon Winter/The New York Times Supported by By Tressie McMillan Cottom Opinion Columnist I have always been audacious about Black women's political aspirations. When I was 15 years old I decided to become a local pageant queen, a Carousel Princess, for our Thanksgiving Parade. It was an uncharacteristic choice. I was an oratory and student government kind of girl. I don't remember much about the pageant except the question portion, in which I was asked, 'What do you want to be in the future?' I intended to be 'the first Black female Supreme Court justice.' The emcee smiled indulgently. I stared defiantly. Some 30 years later, Ketanji Brown Jackson took my Supreme Court justice job. And this week Vice President Kamala Harris almost became the first Black female president. Our policy differences aside, her ascendancy to the top of her party should have felt like the realization of my childhood dreams. Instead, for weeks I have felt isolated in my ennui. As it turns out, Donald Trump was harder to vanquish than so many of us hoped. He won. And today it feels like his brand of identity politics is more audacious than my youthful dreams about a Black female president. The Monday night before Election Day, I drove to my nearby alma mater, North Carolina Central University, with an anxiety headache. In the words of Alice Walker, I went searching for my mother's garden - a connection to the ancestral continuation of Black women's survival and resilience. The campus has a polling place, perhaps in part because I helped organize one my sophomore year in college. It is where I cast my first vote for president. This historically Black college campus in Durham, N.C. - a Southern city that once had a 'Black Wall Street' - is full of the ghosts of voter suppression and dogged Black resilience. It is also home to the ghost of my young, ambitious, audacious self. As I walked across campus, I thought about the prospect of a Harris victory and wondered why I wasn't more excited about the possibility of our first Black female president. Kamala Harris embodies audacity even more than Barack Obama once did. Like Obama, she is of mixed race and identifies as Black. But she is also the child of two immigrants, and she is unquestionably a product of Black American institutions. She is a graduate of Howard University. A member of the first intercollegiate Black sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha. An Oakland pedigree. And she has that silk press. Women of color were among the last minority groups to get the right to vote. The fact that someone who represents those who were last to be included in American democracy came so close to saving this nation from its worst impulses is audacious, by any measure. There will be a lot of accounting of why Harris came so close but did not close the deal. I know two things today. I know the fundamentals of how and why Trump exists - I've written about them too many times to count - and I know that nothing about those fundamentals has changed. I knew that a month ago. I knew it a week ago. I didn't want to know it again today. But this election was about enthusiasm and diagnoses. The long-term trajectory of our country has not changed. Millions of middle-class people feel working-class. These Americans have no way to describe what is happening to them. Is it the borders? Is it supposedly dangerous cities? The loss of God in the classroom? Cultural Marxism? Wokeism? Inflation? Tariffs? Women? Nature abhors a vacuum. But political opportunists thrive in vacuums. This election was about who told
2024110617462	a better story about the fundamentals without promising anything to fix those fundamentals. That is the sweet spot for an opportunist like Trump and his party. Sell everything, promise nothing. Keep them coming back for more. The Harris campaign countered with a relatively hopeful message about the future. But the candidate ultimately ran on a platform of stasis. Her promise was that nothing much would change about the country but the race and gender of the one in charge - and she didn't even lean into a history-making narrative about her race and gender because it felt like a promise she could not keep. A promise of a more audacious America. Maybe how she almost won is the reason she could not win. I was never going to be a big fan of some of Harris's politics. I do not believe in police reform and she is a 'law and order' Democrat, for one example. But I am a pragmatic voter. I know that most Americans are center-right and that the left has not yet built the power base necessary to make most Americans center-left. She was always going to be the only legitimate candidate in a race against Donald Trump, a felon and self-aggrandizing political troll. Perhaps more important, when she became the Democratic nominee, it did not feel like a conquest. It felt like a Hail Mary. The stink of our national desperation has haunted me since Harris accepted the nomination. It called to mind how Black women become firsts in other arenas. Research shows that women often inherit leadership roles when organizations are in crisis. That kind of risk exposure is especially acute for women of color. Desperate companies and nonprofits blow through their wunderkind leaders and turn to women, who often have fewer organizations competing for their talents. They can get them at a good deal - female C.E.O.s often make less than male C.E.O.s. And when the organizational fractures are too deep to be fixed or the female leaders are given too little authority or resources to fix them, they are blamed for the failures they inherited. It was a short election cycle. Harris didn't have a victory lap after early primaries or on Super Tuesday. We did not get a chance to invest in Harris's capabilities, only her willingness to inherit our broken mess. And the early forensics of her campaign read like a funeral program instead of a celebration of life. Notably, there are numerous obituaries for 'identity politics' that argue that Harris's decision to de-emphasize her race and gender in her campaign means that diversity is dead as an overt political strategy. But what if she should have leaned into identity more, risking the white identity voter but telling us a clear story about why electing her would speak about our audacious potential? We cannot know for sure. We do know that she declined to write the narrative of her historic firsts throughout her campaign, while Trump wrote the second volume of his story of which identities should matter most. Harris's campaign positioned race and gender not as strengths to be reclaimed but flaws to be subsumed. If you have to hide the light of your race and gender behind the metaphorical bushes to come vaguely close to being the first Black female president, then identity still matters very much indeed. Imagine someone like Southern-bred Stacey Abrams being the first Black female president. Put aside whether Abrams's politics are better or worse - that is not necessary for this exercise. What matters is that when she ran for governor of Georgia, she leaned into how much race and gender shaped her Americanness. I will never forget her
2024110617463	powerful essay on why her student loan debt made her a better leader, as opposed to a fiscally irresponsible one. She embodied the racial wealth gap that condemns Black Americans to what the sociologist Louise Seamster has called 'bad debt' - the debt we take on to earn our way out of poor economic opportunities. That looks like bad mortgages and upside-down car loans and, yes, student loans for the education we have to have to get our foot in the door. Admittedly, Abrams had to own this part of her political biography. She spent most of her childhood in the South. But if this country were to put a Southern Black woman with the shared experience of millions of working-class and aspirational Black Americans in the White House, her ascendancy would be a statement on this country's original sin. The sin that still animates housing segregation, school inequality, wage inequality and environmental racism. The idea of Abrams as president is merely an example of a different kind of campaign, on an alternate timeline, where being first could have given us a first worth voting for. Will more Black women run because of Kamala Harris? Almost definitely. Will more Black women win using Kamala Harris's playbook? I hope not. Black feminism - and especially the idea of intersectionality - became a pop culture cliche in the 2020s. But Harris took a more traditional second-wave feminist approach to her performance of womanhood. Her campaign did not challenge gender conventions so much as it selectively subverted some gender expectations (and left others intact) for her political benefit. She has this in common with Sarah Palin, another first who almost went the distance. I always believed that a conservative woman would be the first female president because of what social science says about gender and leadership. American voters demand compensating qualities - gun-toting, conventional attractiveness, religiosity - to accept a female president. Harris played that game, finessing that hybrid centrist conservative in a progressive package. That feels like a game plan for the many female candidates who will follow in her footsteps. It is less clear to me that Harris's game plan can ever actually work for a Black female candidate. For one thing, Black women cannot usurp Palin's gun-toting, America-first political shtick. Harris came close. On the trail, Harris (and Walz) talked about packing a gun the way women in politics were once expected to talk about packing their kids' school lunches. She also delighted in being tough on crime. By pivoting to the right, Harris bet that American voters trust female politicians who present as culturally conservative, like Palin. Harris just did it from the Democratic ticket. That choice is part of her legacy. What isn't part of her legacy is the end of identity politics. Try as some might to bury the salience of race, class and gender to political life, identity still matters. And it mattered to Harris's campaign. The devil is in how people misunderstand what identity politics is. The common-sense understanding of identity politics is that it is rooted in the shared group identity based on linked oppressions. That link to oppression is key. It is why only minorities are thought to have an 'identity' in identity politics. By that definition, Kamala Harris would have to bleat her horn about breaking glass ceilings. That is what Hillary Clinton infamously did in her nomination acceptance speech in 2016. She also would have gone Jesse Jackson with a rhyme about hope and dope and a rope that overtly draws on the Black
2024110617464	elegiac tradition. That is what then-candidate Barack Obama did in 2008. Given that her Indian American heritage does not have the same kind of resonant political story as women's and Black Americans', if she had leaned into that identity as a key part of her campaign strategy, she would have had to invent one. If you think identity politics means 'performing an identity,' then Harris bucked the progressive habit of leveraging identity politics. Someone looking to build on her campaign's progress might think that Harris lost because she didn't ham up the guns and nationalism enough and bury her identity even deeper. That is wrong and it is racist. And it is also wrong because it is racist. It is racist to believe that racial identity is an affliction that only weak-willed or weak-minded minorities suffer. When we limit identity politics to minorities, we insist that in politics only nonwhite people have racial identities (and to a lesser extent, that only women have gendered identities). If you accept that everyone has a racial identity - which is very hard to refute - then every political individual engages in identity politics. White voters are also identity voters. In fact, they are the most important of all identity-driven voters. It was their votes that Harris had to court. I thought a lot this election season about a book by the political scientist Ashley Jardina, 'White Identity Politics,' published in 2019, that examines how much white racial attitudes are rooted in their white identity politics. Jardina's data supports the theory that white voters feel, and therefore act, in ways that support their view of themselves as white. They are not necessarily prejudiced against minorities. In fact, Jardina argues that the empirical connection between prejudiced views and white identitarianism is pretty weak. A lot of white people don't feel white and yet vote and act in racially prejudiced ways. And some white people feel white, vote from a white identity and do not particularly act in racially prejudiced ways. White identity voters are not located just in conservative areas, like the South. They aren't all Republicans or conservative voters or poor or working class. Jardina is clear that white identity politics has increased across the income, ideological and geographical spectra. Trump's final electoral map picked up new voters, kept his core voters and found new identity voters - Latinos, Black men and immigrants. Harris may not have emphasized her own identity in her campaign but her campaign absolutely emphasized the interests of those white identity voters who may have leaned toward Trump in 2016. Those voters tend to be threatened by, and therefore obsessed with, immigration. This was the source of candidate Harris's hard center-right turn. Time and time again, she put her experience as a prosecutor and an attorney general forward when she talked about securing the border. She embraced American exceptionalism abroad and policing at home. She did not appear to kowtow to the Democratic Party's left wing. Palestinian supporters did not succeed in getting a Palestinian speaker onstage at the Democratic National Convention. She did not utter now-toxic slogans like 'abolish the police.' And she pushed back on those who tried to position her as a 'D.E.I.' candidate. Neoconservatives like Dick Cheney endorsed Harris not only because Trump is so dangerous; on issues like national and domestic security, it's hard to pass a light between her positions and those of a typical conservative. The nation's first Black woman on a national
2024110617465	ticket tapped into the white identity voters' nationalism. She pitched herself to the white identitarian coalition that Trump has played like a fiddle. That is just more of the white identity politics on which American politics were built - and that the Black franchise should always be an indictment of. Obama's coalition feels like an aberration and it is time for us to accept that American politics is identity politics. It is a battle for the identities that will be named and shamed, while others are granted anonymity and power. Playing to the silent white identitarian does not guarantee victory if you aren't a white identity candidate. If we learn anything from Harris's loss, it should be that we must stop sacrificing the power of other identities - their values, their hopes, their security - for a chance that will not pan out. Black women have saved democracy enough times to deserve more than cosmetic diversity. We deserve more than hope and change. We deserve recognition and power. Above all, we deserve better than a post at the head of a sinking ship that reveres the iceberg. All this isn't to say the Harris campaign did not leave a mark. She proved the continuing importance of Black institutional life. The schools and churches and social groups that Black Americans cobbled together from the ashes of white violence and dispossession made her candidacy possible. Wealthy donors make you competitive. But a base makes you viable. Her competitiveness proved that Black culture can still make a powerful base. Kamala Harris would not be the first Black female vice president were it not for Howard University, a historically Black college, and her affiliation with Alpha Kappa Alpha, a Black Greek-letter sorority. Even her political base in California's Bay Area tapped into that area's racial history - the Black migration that built racial enclaves that became microsites of political power. Whether or not Harris's campaign alters the political imagination for Black female electoral power, the institutions she has brought along with her just might. But it won't be today, and it won't be this year. Tressie McMillan Cottom (@tressiemcphd) became a New York Times Opinion columnist in 2022.

2024110623591	Bison who are changing the world to make it a better place right now and for future generations. No matter the outcome of the 2024 presidential election, one thing is certain. Upon her election as vice president of the United States, Kamala Devi Harris became the highest-ranking woman ever in public service. On Harris' journey to history, she has broken barrier after barrier and shattered glass ceilings into millions of pieces. Most recently, she became the first HBCU graduate to ever receive a major presidential nomination. For other institutions, she might represent an anomaly of excellence. At Howard, she is simply a part of our lineage of leadership. Because you went to Howard University, you have a responsibility to keep reaching for that bar and keep serving.' In the expansive temporal tome that is Howard history, Harris occupies plenty of pages; First Black district attorney of San Francisco; First Black and first woman of South Asian descent to become a United States senator from California. The only woman to be part of a winning presidential ticket. Harris has always made it crystal clear that her public service is 'for the people,' meaning all of the people. However, her HBCU roots are dear to her, and she has seized every opportunity to uplift her Alma Mater. After she launched her first run for the presidency in 2019, she held her first press conference at Howard. Throughout her vice presidency, she returned many times to discuss economic empowerment and reproductive rights. She tossed the opening coin at the 2023 Celebration Bowl in Atlanta, during which the Howard Bison took on the Florida A&M Rattlers, and invited Bison athletes to visit her in the Naval Observatory. She came back home to Howard many times during her historic 2024 presidential campaign, using the campus as a place of comfort and renewal. In so many meaningful ways, both high profile and subtle, she has shown her devotion to her Alma Mater and her interest in its continued advancement. Tens of thousands of Bison around the country are extremely proud and grateful. Much of her success can be attributed to her tight embrace of Howard's core principles of truth and service. She reinforced the importance of this principle when talking to Howard graduates at the University's 149th Commencement ceremony in 2017. 'Speaking the truth means you must speak up, and you must speak out, even when you are not asked,' she said. 'Even when it is uncomfortable or inconvenient.' 'The thing that Howard taught me is that you can do any collection of things, and not one thing to the exclusion of the other.' In Fall 1982, Harris made the trek to Washington, D.C., to the hallowed grounds of Howard University. She already certain of who she was - and, seemingly, who she desired to be. In her 2019 memoir 'The Truths We Hold,' Harris delved into her abiding passion for social justice and how that interest -by one of the nation's most iconic attorneys and civil rights icons - influenced her decision to attend Howard University for her postsecondary education. 'I wanted to get off on the right foot,'' Harris wrote. 'And what better place to do that, I thought, than at Thurgood Marshall's alma mater?' Harris pursued political science and economics as her majors and immediately demonstrated both her intellectual curiosity and spirit for service during her years at The Mecca. Her first campaign came as a first-year undergraduate for the Liberal Arts Student Council. She later chaired the Economics Society and became a standout on the University's speech and debate team, refining the
2024110623592	rhetorical skills fundamental to her professional career. Harris also was selected as one of 38 spring 1986 initiates into the Alpha chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated, the oldest Black Greek letter organization for women. 'When you're at an HBCU, and especially one with the size and with the history of Howard University - and also in the context of also being in DC, which was known forever as being 'Chocolate City' - it just becomes about you understanding that there is a whole world of people who are like you,' Harris was quoted in a 2019 Washington Post article. 'It's not just about there are a few of us who may find each other.' Harris would also begin to leverage her access to the levers of power stationed in the nation's capital, joining her fellow Bison in anti-apartheid protests at the National Mall and the South African embassy. Ahead of her third year at Howard, Harris interned in the office of California Senator Alan Cranston, a seat to which she herself would ascend three decades later. During her Howard undergraduate career, Harris would also secure internships with the Federal Trade Commission and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. By Harris' college graduation in 1986, she was primed for a career in the legal field, undergirded by the classroom education and experiential learning opportunities provided to her by Howard University. Soon, she would be making history as an attorney in California, and as a civil servant for the nation. 'The thing that Howard taught me is that you can do any collection of things, and not one thing to the exclusion of the other,' Harris said. 'You could be homecoming queen and valedictorian. There are no false choices at Howard.' Harris' experience on the debate team at Howard no doubt prepared her for the next chapters in her journey. She earned a law degree from the University of California, Hastings College of Law. As a young prosecutor in Alameda County, Calif., she took on tough cases in Berkeley and Oakland in the height of the crack epidemic. She also dealt with child sexual assault. She defeated an incumbent to become the district attorney in San Francisco, the first Black person to do so in the state of California. True to her philosophy of not accepting false choices, Harris focused on aggressively prosecuting criminals but also creating paths to rehabilitation. She helped non-violent criminals get job training and worked to keep young offenders in school. 'In my career, the conventional wisdom was that people are either soft on crime or tough on crime, but I knew we should be smart on crime,' she told the audience at the Howard University's 149th Commencement. She waged a campaign for attorney general promising to be a pragmatic law enforcer, and instituted unprecedent policies to tackle issues. She tackled an alarming trend in truancy by implementing laws which held parents accountable and led to parental prosecutions. She defended the state death penalty law even though she was personally opposed to it. 'She is focused on the end result and the impact she can have on people's lives less than the process,' Brian Brokaw, who managed Harris' state attorney general campaigns, told the BBC. Harris had a full circle moment in 2016 when she was elected to the U.S. Senate to represent California, given that she interned for Senator Alan Cranston as a mailroom clerk as a Howard student. She inherited the seat from the legendary Barbara Boxer. In the Senate, she brought her prosecutorial style to Senate hearings, helping to hold administration officials accountable.
2024110623593	She also advocated for stricter gun control legislation. The Harris and Biden Administration's record includes multi-dynamic initiatives in aspects of American work life, protection against climate change, and economic rebuild after the pandemic. 'There's no question that working people are paying more gas, more groceries and that is why for our administration it is one of our highest priorities to bring down the costs,' Harris told reporter Robert Costa during her Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan appearance on July 10, 2022. This year alone, The Biden-Harris administration signed the Broadband, Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program, which proposes $42.45 billion for high-speed internet access and the appropriate infrastructure to hold the bandwidth. Demanding internet for all, the latest BEAD funds have granted 2.4 million homes and small businesses with premium internet access. The Biden-Harris administration's policies include the Inflation Reduction Act which made insulin prices cap at $35 for more than 8 million Americans. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also emphasizes improvements in the areas of transportation, environmental, and broadband access. A proud Howard alumna, Harris also zeroed in on expanding the resources, opportunities, and services that HBCUs provide. As of October 9, The Harris-Biden Administration totaled their HBCU federal investments to $17 billion. The administration cited that, though HBCUs make up just 3% of all higher education institutions, HBCUs house 'twice as many Pell grantees from low- and middle-income families.' This rings true for Howard especially, as an estimated 41% of the student body receive federal Pell grants. Their Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, a student debt relief plan for nearly 5 million Americans was a direct attempt at eradicating America's racial wealth gap. According to the Education Data Initiative, forgiving student debt affects Black college graduates who owe nearly $25,000 more than white college graduates. Harris has also invited HBCU students to The White House. Last February, The Biden-Harris administration hosted their HBCU Celebration Day in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building to close out Black History Month. Student leaders and graduates gathered to discuss policy issues affecting HBCUs along with workforce advice for those graduating in Spring 2024. In 2023, 32 HBCU student journalists were invited to The White House in an intimate question-and-answer session that delved into the importance of their work from the experience of an HBCU education. Keisha Lance Bottoms, the former senior advisor to President Biden and alumna of Florida A&M University, facilitated the event. 'One of the blessings that I realized is [we] have a special responsibility, because you have had the good fortune and blessing of being in an academic environment that, in every way, from the walls that were constructed in your classmates and why they were built, you have the unique ability to know that we are counting on you and you represent the best of who we are,' Harris told the HBCU student journalists. 'We are requiring you to lead because we have learned in [HBCUs] that we stand on broad shoulders. They imagined we'd be having this conversation at the White House.' Harris' seven-stop HBCU Homecoming Tour was another intimate look for HBCU students and gave young Black voters an opportunity to understand her campaign up-close. Howard University 100th Homecoming anniversary celebration was slated for the opportunity, however, instead of an in-person appearance,
2024110623594	Harris wrote an exclusive letter to The Hilltop. 'At Howard, we learn that we have the capacity to be great and also that we have the responsibility to work hard to live up to that potential each day,' Harris wrote to Howardites. 'We know more needs to be done, and we look forward to continuing to work alongside you as we build a brighter future for all.' As Harris eyed American history as the first Black woman and South Asian woman to become president, the first president to hail from an HBCU, she returned to Alma Mater to begin a new chapter. The Harris-Walz campaign decided on The Yard as their final stop of relentless campaigning to convince voters that Harris, once a Bison with just a vision and self-belief , could etch a new chapter of American history. 'The first office I ever ran for was freshman class representative at Howard University,' Harris told V-103 Radio Station the morning of the election. 'To go back tonight to Howard, my beloved alma mater, and be able to hopefully...recognize this day for what it is, it's full circle for me.' An age-old mantra says that Black people have to be twice as good to get half as far. At no time was that adage on fuller display than during the 2024 presidential cycle, when Harris was called upon to stand up a presidential campaign in the shortest amount of time any major party candidate has ever attempted. But Harris proved she was up to this task, and she and other Bison will continue to elevate humanity through their extraordinary competence and commitment. She put it best in her 2017 Commencement speech. 'Because you are a Howard graduate, the bar is high,' she said, 'Which means you must be on the front line. You must be the first to raise your hand. You must be at the front of the line. You must lead. The bar can sometimes feel so high. It takes so much time and effort to reach it. So much sweat and so many tears. Being human, we sometimes fall short. That is ok. Because you went to Howard University, you have a responsibility to keep reaching for that bar and keep serving.'

2024110701111	The Democrat congratulated her Republican rival during a phone call and offered to help with peaceful transfer of power. Vice President Kamala Harris has sought to reassure her supporters that, while they did not win the United States presidential election this year, the fight is far from over. 'The outcome of the election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for,' she said in a concession speech to a crowd of students and supporters at Howard University in Washington, DC, her alma mater. 'Hear me when I say the light of America's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting.' Her address on Wednesday afternoon was the first time Harris had spoken to her supporters since Republican candidate Donald Trump won the race. Many had waited outside in tears on the university grounds on Tuesday night as the election unfolded. But an expected late-night speech never materialised: Her campaign director emerged to tell them that Harris was going to wait until more results came in. By early Wednesday, the race had been called for Trump, who passed the threshold of 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency. The mood on Wednesday afternoon was decidedly more upbeat when Harris spoke, with huge cheers and screams emanating from the crowd. 'I know folks have a range of emotions, I get it,' Harris said with a laugh. 'I spoke with Trump and congratulated him and told him we will help him with the transition and engage with a peaceful transfer of power.' Harris then made a pointed dig at Trump who campaigned on his refusal to concede that he lost the 2020 presidential election to President Joe Biden. 'It's a fundamental principle of a democracy that when we lose an election, we accept the result,' she said. But Harris added that did not mean she was giving up. 'While I concede this election I don't not concede the fight that fuelled this campaign,' she said. 'To the young people, it is OK to feel sad and disappointed. Please know it will be OK.' She added: 'On the campaign, we say when we fight we win, sometimes the fight takes a while . It doesn't mean we won't win.' Harris ended her speech by thanking her husband Doug Emhoff for his support. 'I know many people feel like we are entering a dark time, but for the benefit of all of us, I hope that is not the case,' she said. Harris, 60, began campaigning after Biden stepped out of the race after stumbling badly in a June presidential debate with Trump. His performance sparked concerns about his ability to serve until the end of a second term in 2029, when he would be 86. Biden dropped out of the race on July 21 and endorsed his vice president. Harris quickly took over the Democratic campaign. She was seen among many Democrats as a potential saviour for her party: the first Black woman and the first person of South Asian descent who could reach the Oval Office. Four years ago, she broke the same barriers for the vice presidency by becoming Biden's second in command. Harris ran an energetic campaign focused on moving away from Trump's dark message of economic ruin and immigrants flooding the country. A key element of her platform was her advocacy for women's reproductive freedom, a rallying cry that resonated with many young voters who flocked to her rallies. The 2024 race was the first presidential campaign since the US Supreme Court struck down constitutional protection for abortion rights two years prior, in June 2022. The Harris campaign had hoped for a surge of support from women. But it wasn't enough to
2024110701112	overcome the deep anger among US voters over high inflation, the cost of basic necessities such as food and housing, and worries about undocumented immigration, according to exit polls. Trump's promise to return to a 'golden age of America' saw the key battleground states move decisively away from the Democrats. He is due to take office on January 20, 2025, returning to power as the 47th US president four years after refusing to accept defeat to President Joe Biden. As the sitting vice president, Harris is expected to oversee Congress's ceremonial certification of Trump's win. Biden has also said he will attend the inauguration, unlike Trump in 2021 who snubbed his successor. Follow Al Jazeera English:

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) Follow live: Updates from AP's coverage of the presidential election. WASHINGTON (AP) - Faced with a sweeping rejection by American voters, Kamala Harris conceded the presidential election to Donald Trump on Wednesday and encouraged supporters to continue fighting for their vision of the country. The Democratic vice president said the battle would continue 'in the voting booth, in the courts and in the public square.' 'Sometimes the fight takes a while,' she said at Howard University, her alma mater, where she had hoped to make a victory speech after the election. 'That doesn't mean we won't win.' Harris' decisive defeat shattered hopes that she could rescue Democrats' chances after President Joe Biden's reelection effort stalled and she replaced him at the top of the ticket. She trailed in
2024110623442	every battleground state to Trump, a Republican whom she described as an existential danger to the country's foundational institutions. And Trump appeared on track to win the popular vote for the first time in his three campaigns for the White House - even after two impeachments, felony convictions and his attempt to overturn his previous election loss. Despite her stark warnings about Trump, Harris reached for optimism on Wednesday. 'It is OK to feel sad and disappointed, but please know it's going to be OK,' she told supporters as some of them wiped tears from their eyes. Biden released a statement praising Harris after her speech, saying: 'She will continue the fight with purpose, determination, and joy. She will continue to be a champion for all Americans. Above all, she will continue to be a leader our children will look up to for generations to come as she puts her stamp on America's future.' Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris' running mate, was in the audience with his family. So were Reps. Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker, and Barbara Lee, both from Harris' home state of California.

Donate to the AP. Before her speech, Harris called Trump to congratulate him on his victory. She told the crowd that 'we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power,' an implicit reference to Trump's unwillingness to do the same four years ago. Some in the audience expressed disappointment that Harris was not able to make history as the country's first Black female president. Harris would also have been first U.S. president of South Asian descent Gregory Pate, 38, said he appreciated that Harris said she was 'committed to the fight and not looking at this as a permanent defeat, but just another obstacle that we have to go through as Black people.' 'I think it was perfect. I think that it was timely, and it was a message that I came to hear,' said Pate, of Fairfax, Virginia. Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris, left, speaks with Ike Irby, senior advisor to the vice president, and Kirsten Allen, communications director to the vice president, shortly before taking the stage for Harris' final campaign rally, Monday, Nov. 4, 2024, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) Jay Evans, of Greenbelt, Maryland, said after Harris' spoke that he's wistful for what could have been. 'We're partly sad, because hearing her speak, she would have been an amazing person to bring the country together and to keep us in a better path,' Evans said. After Trump lost to Biden, he directed his supporters to march on the U.S. Capitol, leading to a violent insurrection that interrupted the ceremonial certification of the election results. Now Harris is expected to oversee the same certification process to finalize Trump's victory as voters brush off concerns about the future of American democracy and return the former Republican president to the White House. Biden plans to address the election results on Thursday. The White House said he spoke with Harris and Trump on Wednesday, and he invited the president-elect to meet with him soon. David Plouffe, a top Harris adviser, said campaign staffers 'left it all on the field for their country.' 'We dug out of a deep hole but not enough,' he said. 'A devastating loss.' Harris became the Democratic candidate after Biden, who was already struggling to convince voters that he could serve as president until he was 86
2024110623443	years old, stumbled badly in his June 27 debate with Trump. He dropped out of the race on July 21 and endorsed his vice president, who swiftly unified the Democratic Party around her candidacy. It was a remarkable twist of fate for Harris. Four years earlier, her own presidential campaign had flamed out and revealed the political limitations of someone once dubbed 'the female Barack Obama.' Even though Biden chose Harris as his running mate, she languished in the role after taking office as the first woman, Black person or person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president. Some Democrats started writing her off when they pondered the party's future after Biden. But Harris found fresh purpose after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, and she became the White House's leading advocate for abortion rights. Harris also made a more concerted effort to network with local politicians, business leaders and cultural figures, forging connections that could serve her down the road. The moment arrived sooner than she anticipated, and she was catapulted into the presidential race with Biden's departure only a month before the Democratic National Convention. Harris instantly reset the terms of the contest with Trump. She was 18 years younger and a former courtroom prosecutor going up against the first major presidential candidate convicted of crimes. Her candidacy energized Democrats who feared they were destined for defeat with Biden at the top of the ticket. But she also faced steep odds from the beginning. She inherited Biden's political operation with just 107 days until the end of the election, and she faced a restless electorate that was eager for change. Although Harris pitched 'a new way forward,' she struggled to meaningfully differentiate herself from the unpopular sitting president. In addition, she had limited time to introduce herself to skeptical voters, who never cast a ballot for her in a presidential primary. Democrats now face the prospect of picking up the pieces during a second Trump presidency, and it's unclear what role Harris will play in her party's future. 'The work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump Presidency starts now,' wrote Jen O'Malley Dillon, Harris' campaign chair, in a letter to staff. 'I know the Vice President isn't finished in this fight, and I know the very people on this email are also going to be leaders in this collective mission.' Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

2024110710441	As the dust settled on the 2024 election, Vice President Kamala Harris officially conceded the race to President-elect Donald Trump yesterday. Despite her attempts to make history as the first female president, Harris was unsuccessful in denying Trump a second term, and announced the end of her campaign in Washington, D.C. Judgments on why and how Harris lost are already being issued, with blame being laid on figures in the campaign, President Joe Biden, and even the voters themselves. Newsweek contacted a representative of the Harris campaign for comment on this story via email. Looking for a new perspective, Newsweek asked artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT what it thought happened on Election Day, using the prompt: 'Explain why Vice President Kamala Harris lost the 2024 Election to former President Donald Trump. 'Give reasons for your answer, with reference to the Electoral College, turnout, the 2024 election campaign, the strengths and weaknesses of each candidate, and the issues that were most relevant to voters.' ChatGPT responded: 'Vice President Kamala Harris' loss to former President Donald Trump in the 2024 U.S. presidential election can be attributed to several key factors. 'Trump secured victory by flipping critical swing states that he had lost in 2020, notably Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Wisconsin. These states provided the necessary electoral votes to surpass the 270-vote threshold required for the presidency. His success in these battlegrounds was pivotal, as they were instrumental in determining the election outcome. 'The election witnessed high voter turnout across the nation. Trump's campaign effectively mobilized his base, particularly in rural and working-class areas, leading to increased participation among these demographics. Conversely, Harris struggled to generate comparable enthusiasm among key Democratic constituencies, including younger voters and certain minority groups, resulting in lower turnout in critical regions. 'Trump's campaign capitalized on economic concerns, emphasizing issues like inflation and immigration, which resonated with many voters. He also expanded his appeal to minority voters, notably among Latino and Black communities, which contributed to his broader coalition. 'In contrast, Harris's campaign faced challenges in clearly differentiating her platform from the previous administration's policies, leading to perceptions of continuity rather than change. Additionally, her messaging on economic policies did not sufficiently address the pressing concerns of working-class voters.' The chatbot also highlighted Trump's struggle with legal battles throughout the race, saying: 'Despite facing legal challenges and controversies, Trump demonstrated resilience and maintained a strong connection with his base. His messaging on economic issues and border security appealed to a broad spectrum of voters, including some who had previously supported Democratic candidates. 'As the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket, Harris's candidacy was historic. However, she faced difficulties in connecting with working-class voters and articulating a distinct vision separate from the Biden administration. Her campaign also struggled to effectively counter misinformation and address concerns about economic policies, which undermined her appeal in key demographics.'

2024110622431	2024 Elections In her concession speech, she included an implicit rebuke of the president-elect. Vice President Kamala Harris waves to the crowd following her concession speech at Howard University in Washington, on Nov. 6, 2024, after losing the presidential election to Donald Trump. | Angelina Katsanis/POLITICO By Eugene Daniels and Myah Ward 11/06/2024 05:43 PM EST Link Copied It was decades ago when Kamala Harris forged her political identity on the grounds of Howard University. And on Wednesday, she returned to the campus to mark the end of her short, historic run for the White House. Less than 24 hours from when she was expected to address a waiting jubilant crowd, Harris stood in front of the Frederick Douglass Memorial Hall at her alma mater. Gone were the throngs of Howard students hoping to see one of their own lead the country. Instead, forlorn and crying staffers were front and center, hoping to hear their boss help them process the loss. 'While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign. The fight for freedom, for opportunity, for fairness and for the dignity of all people. A fight for the ideals at the heart of our nation. The ideals that reflect an America at our best. That is a fight I will never give up,' the vice president said. While not the speech of the next president of the United States, it was clearly a speech she and her team hope will set her up to be the leader of whatever resistance the party is able to muster up in a Trump presidency. 'Do not despair. This is not a time to throw up our hands, this is a time to roll up our sleeves,' Harris told the crowd. 'The fight for our freedom will take hard work. But like I say, hard work is good work, hard work can be joyful work, and the fight for our country is always worth it.' This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Senior Harris aides are still torn on what happened and know the recriminations have already started: Biden should have never run for reelection. The racism and sexism in the country was too much to overcome. She should have distanced herself from the administration's Middle East policy. It really was just the economy, stupid. According to multiple Harris aides and allies granted anonymity this result is, in ways, easier to swallow. Had it been the razor-thin margins they anticipated, they say, she and them would spend the next few weeks thinking through every interview (or lack thereof) to catch the wrong phrase, or which battleground she should have visited more. Instead, many feel there was something deeper in the electorate that they could not easily overcome. After Biden's disastrous debate in June and his withdrawal from the race after several weeks of heavy pressure from Democrats, Harris quickly became the party's consensus choice in a history-making bid. At 60, she is some two decades younger than Biden, 81, and Trump, who is 78. The vice president moved to call Democratic leaders to shore up her support and benefited from an early surge in momentum, energizing voters apathetic about another Biden-Trump rematch. Yet while Democrats basked in the excitement surrounding her candidacy, Harris and her team were under an exceedingly compressed timeline. She had to take over a bloated campaign organization and attempt to add some of her new staff all while selecting a running mate; prepare for the debate with Trump; and deliver an acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention. And since Harris and her advisers had gone through
2024110622432	such lengths to not appear out of step with Biden after his disastrous debate, she was starting from zero with just four months to go. One of the most pivotal, early decisions she made was to not emphasize the history-making elements of her identity as she sought to become the first female president of the United States - and also the first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent. The campaign believed she had to broaden her appeal, and that downplaying her identity would ensure voters who may not prioritize it were open to her candidacy. Janay Smith gives a long hug to her friend Tene Dolphin before Vice President Kamala Harris' concession event at Howard University in Washington, on Nov. 6, 2024. | Angelina Katsanis/POLITICO Her loss comes in one of the most tumultuous presidential races in U.S. history. Trump, the first president to become a convicted felon, will soon become only the second U.S. president, after Grover Cleveland, to regain the office after losing power. The final five months of the campaign included Trump's felony convictions on 34 charges related to hush money payments to a porn star and Trump being shot in the ear by a would-be assassin during a campaign rally, the first of two attempts on his life during the election cycle. In the final weekend before the election, Trump was still laboring under the controversy of his racist Madison Square Garden rally and adopting increasingly violent rhetoric - including saying he didn't 'mind' if someone had to 'shoot through' the media - while at times appearing to lose track of what state he was campaigning in. To many Democrats, it seemed the race was shifting. But Trump remained resilient. The outcome was in doubt from start to finish, with polls in all seven battleground states within the margin of error. And while she raised enormous sums of money - allowing her to outspend Trump on the air and on field work - Democrats at times expressed concerns about her campaign strategy. Just five years after she first ran for president, pitching herself as a progressive, Harris in her 2024 race aggressively courted moderates and disaffected Republicans. She leaned on former Trump officials and Republicans speaking out about the former president, and campaigned with members of the GOP like former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney. In the closing weeks of her campaign, the vice president homed in on an argument that a second Trump term posed a grave threat to democracy, returning to a message from the Biden era. The vice president delivered her closing argument from the Ellipse, the site of Trump's Jan. 6 rally - a venue her aides viewed as the perfect location for Harris to deliver a contrasting message about how she plans to govern. As some Democrats urged Harris to make democracy just one component of her closing argument, she delivered a forward-looking speech focused on her campaign's broader message: that Trump is focused on himself and his 'enemies list' while she will prioritize her 'to-do' list for Americans. And in her final speech of this campaign, Harris nodded to those same themes that animated the closing aspects of her campaign, with an implicit rebuke of the new president-elect.

On Tuesday, they decided not only were they fine with going back, they preferred it almost across the board. And now, Harris has to figure out how to move forward, and more importantly assist her party and supporters to do the same. Aides hope this speech is the beginning of those next steps. 'The important thing is don't ever give up. Don't ever stop trying to make the world a better place. You have power. And don't you ever listen when anyone tells you something is impossible because it has never been done before,' Harris said. 2024 POLITICO LLC These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation.

2024110620571	Commentary November 6, 2024 Campaigns & Elections Congress Political Parties Presidency Governance Studies Center for Effective Public Management Election '24: Issues at Stake Trump won a personal victory in the 2024 election, sweeping all the swing states, improving his vote share just about everywhere, and-unlike his 2016 victory-garnering an outright majority of the popular vote. In addition, he led the Republican Party to a larger-than-expected Senate majority and, although many House races remain to be called, an expanded House majority may result as well. These gains are more than incremental; indeed, they may signal a new era in American politics. Political scientists and historians will spend years analyzing the causes and significance of this election. My focus is more immediate. Although the data are imperfect and incomplete, I will offer preliminary answers to two questions, which are really two sides of the same coin: Why did Donald Trump win the 2024 presidential election, and why did Kamala Harris lose? Donald Trump's theory of the case was broadly correct. He and his campaign managers believed that it was possible to build on Republicans' growing strength among white working-class voters to create a multi-ethnic working-class coalition. He was right: If the exit polls turn out to be accurate, he made strides among Latinos and African Americans, especially men. He increased his share of the Black male vote from 12% to 20% and carried Hispanic men by nine points, 54% to 45%. The Trump campaign also believed that they could improve their performance among young adults, and they did-from 35% in 2020 to 42% this year. Anecdotal evidence suggests that most of this gain reflected a shift toward Trump among young men. Trump spent lots of time on podcasts, such as Joe Rogan's, whose principal audiences are this otherwise hard-to-reach group. After the Republican primaries, the victorious Trump forces faced a choice: They could moderate their message to reach out to disappointed backers of Nikki Haley, who ran a traditional Reagan conservative campaign, or they could continue their all-out appeal to the Republican base while enjoying the grudging support of his defeated adversary. They chose the latter course and won the gamble that the party would unite around them. Donald Trump received 94% of the Republican vote and as a bonus, reduced the Democratic edge among Independents from nine points in 2020 to five points this year. The Trump campaign's tactical choices paid off. Three turned out to be critical. First: Convinced that Trump's intense personal bond with his supporters would do most of the mobilizing work, the campaign decided not to invest heavily in traditional get-out-the-vote organizing and instead outsourced it to supporting organizations. Although the Harris campaign touted its advantage in the 'ground game,' there is little evidence that it made much of a difference. Second: The Trump campaign decided that Harris' stance on transgender issues was the Willie Horton of 2024 and invested heavily in negative advertising that dominated the airwaves throughout the South.1 Anecdotal evidence suggests that this campaign helped weaken Harris' effort to portray herself as a common-sense center-left candidate rather than an emissary from San Francisco. Third: Donald Trump chose to modulate his stance on abortion by declaring early on that each state should decide this matter for itself and then doubling down by vowing to veto a national abortion ban. Many longtime foes of abortion were disappointed, and some were outraged.
2024110620572	Nevertheless, Trump paid no price, winning 81% of the white evangelical vote-virtually unchanged from four years ago. The Harris campaign was always running uphill. She served as vice president to a president whose approval rating plunged in the middle of his first year in office and never recovered. The public's judgment of his performance on two core issues-inflation and immigration-was harshly negative, and Harris inherited this disapproval when Joe Biden abandoned his quest for a second term. The fact that Biden waited so long to leave the race also worked against Harris. The president's tardy decision deprived her of the opportunity to sharpen her arguments in a primary fight and shortened the time she had to introduce herself to the voters. She did the best she could in the circumstances by quickly unifying the party and building on Biden's campaign apparatus rather than starting from scratch, but she never entirely overcame the difficulties stemming from Biden's timetable. Harris' theory of the case was flawed. Looking at examples from the 2022 elections, she assumed that putting reproductive rights at the center of her agenda would mobilize an army of angry women and move them to the polls in record numbers. This did not happen. Women's share of the total vote rose only marginally from its level in 2020, and Harris' share of the women who voted did not increase from Biden's 2020 levels. It is hard to judge how much this emphasis on abortion contributed to Harris' poor showing among men-just 43%, down from Biden's 48% in 2020-but it did nothing to convince them that a Harris administration would be sensitive to their concerns. Her closing argument-that Donald Trump posed a clear and present danger to democracy-fared little better. This happened in part because many Republicans and Independents saw Harris and the Democrats as the real threats to democracy, and also because the charge offered no new information that would sway voters whose minds weren't made up. Donald Trump may be the best-known candidate in modern American history, making it difficult to change anyone's view of him. Harris' tactical choices made her problems worse. First, she spurned opportunities to create a clearer political profile. Although Biden's unpopularity burdened her campaign, she refused to separate herself from him in any way that broke through to persuadable voters. Similarly, by refusing to explain why she had abandoned the progressive positions on crime, immigration, health care, and climate change, she blurred the public's perception of her and opened the door to the Trump campaign's charge that she was a closet radical. Thinking back to the successful campaign of Bill Clinton in 1992, some Democrats were hoping Harris would have a 'Sister Souljah' moment in which she broke with some party orthodoxy in order to show her independence, but this did not happen. Second, Harris' decision to avoid media interviews during the first half of her campaign created the impression that she was dependent on scripted remarks and afraid to think on her feet. Answering tough questions can enhance a candidate's reputation for competence and character, a potential upside to which Harris and her campaign seemed oblivious for much too long. Democrats knew that the election would be close, but the scope of their defeat will likely trigger recriminations first and then an extended period of soul-searching. As was the case after Michael Dukakis' defeat in 1988, the party will be forced to engage in a debate about the causes of its defeat, and what is sure to be a
2024110620573	long and lively primary campaign will determine the path forward. Meanwhile, President Trump will be challenged to honor the sweeping promises he made during his campaign. It remains to be seen whether he can impose massive tariffs without raising costs for average families and triggering another round of inflation. Also uncertain is whether he can quell conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East as quickly as he claims while reducing America's global commitments. And it is possible that trying to deport millions of immigrants present in the U.S. could blow up in his face by creating civil strife and a backlash among Latino voters who have rallied to this cause. If he fails to meet the hopes that he has aroused, especially in the new supporters who provided his majority, he and his party may pay a price in 2026 and beyond.

2024110709561	Kamala Harris of the Democrat party has 67,951,111 votes (47.5%) Donald Trump of the Republican party has 72,658,972 votes (50.8%) Defeated Democratic candidate Kamala Harris has urged her supporters to accept Donald Trump's White House victory, while telling them to 'never give up' fighting for their ideals. At a concession speech in Washington DC, the US vice-president acknowledged 'the outcome of this election is not what we wanted', but insisted there must be a peaceful transfer of power. Harris, who cancelled a victory speech that had been planned at the same venue one night earlier, also told the crowd not to despair. Trump has won enough key battleground states, including Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Wisconsin, to secure the presidency, with several states left to declare. Harris said in Wednesday's remarks from her alma mater, Howard University: 'Hear me when I say, the light of America's promise will always burn bright. As long as we never give up, and as long as we keep fighting.' She took the stage to her campaign song Freedom by Beyonce before thanking her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, her campaign staff, supporters, poll workers and election officials. Many in the audience wiped away tears during her remarks. 'I know folks are experiencing a range of emotions right now,' she said with a chuckle. 'I get it. But we must respect the results of this election.' Her supporters responded with loud boos when she noted that she had had a phone call with President-elect Trump, and 'I told him we will help him and his team with his transition. And we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power.' 'While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fuelled this campaign,' she added. Her speech referenced 'fight' or 'fighting' 19 times. During the campaign the rivals often traded insults, with Harris calling Trump a 'fascist' and a threat to American democracy. Harris told her supporters on Wednesday: 'I know many people feel like we are entering a dark time. But for the benefit of us all, I hope that is not the case.' The former California senator was running to become the first woman, black woman and South-Asian American to win the presidency. Harris and Trump spoke by phone on Wednesday, and discussed 'the importance of a peaceful transfer of power and being a president for all Americans', a Harris aide told journalists. A spokesman for Trump said that on the call, the president-elect 'acknowledged Vice-President Harris on her strength, professionalism, and tenacity throughout the campaign, and both leaders agreed on the importance of unifying the country'. In a separate call with Biden, the president 'congratulated the Vice-President on her historic campaign', according to a White House readout of the call. Biden watched Harris's speech live at the White House, one of his aides said. One Harris supporter, Charles Collins, flew in from San Francisco to be at Howard University on Wednesday. 'I'm moving through the process of grief,' he told the BBC. 'But Kamala asked us to heal, so we can get to work.' The crowd at Howard University was noticeably smaller than it was on Tuesday night, and the atmosphere was sombre. Many supporters wore black, instead of the bright pink colours of Harris's sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha. 'I feel pretty hopeless right now,' said Howard law student Najah Lorde. 'I think a lot of us are lost right now.' A young woman who declined to give her name, saying she could not speak to media as an employee of the federal government, told the BBC: 'I cannot grapple with the fact that

Some 54% of female voters cast their ballots for her, below the 57% of women Joe Biden won in 2020. Black and Latino voters also appeared slightly less likely to support Harris than they were to back Biden four years ago, exit poll data suggested. The campaign faced criticism at times for its failure to expand on a clear economic message, an issue which was extremely important to Americans who have faced several years of rising inflation.

2024110710341	Democratic figures have hit out against Vice President Kamala Harris, her choice of running mate, and how she ran her campaign following the vice president's crushing election defeat to Donald Trump. The nature of the presidential election loss, as well as the party losing control of the Senate and possibly the House to the GOP, has left some Democrats angry and questioning the future of the party. A number of Democratic lawmakers, operatives, and aides have now given their views on why Harris suffered such a heavy loss in the November 5 election. These range from her choosing Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as the vice presidential candidate, failing to distance herself enough from President Joe Biden, to the party abandoning working class voters. Others have laid the blame purely on Biden for not dropping out of the 2024 race sooner and for giving Harris the difficult job of winning over voters after he recorded at times historically low approval ratings. Biden's term in office saw high levels of inflation and a cost of living crisis, with voters frequently citing the economy as their number one election issue. Newsweek has contacted the White House and Harris' campaign team for comment via email. Independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 and 2020, blamed the party and its leadership for ignoring working class voters during the 'disastrous' campaign. 'It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them,' Sanders said in a statement. 'First it was the working class, and now it is Latino and Black voters as well. While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change. And they're right.' David Sirota, a senior adviser for Sanders' 2020 presidential campaign, expressed a similar sentiment about why Harris and the party had a 'very bad night' in the election. 'Some of us spent years warning Dems to take working-class politics more seriously and to not tout neocons,' Sirota posted on X, formerly Twitter. 'We did so in hopes of avoiding this, and yet we were vilified as traitors by Dem elites and liberal pundits. There's a lesson here.' Lindy Li, a political commentator and Democratic National Committee member, suggested that Harris made a mistake in picking Walz over Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro as her running mate. Shapiro was seen as one of the front-runners for the vice presidential candidate position to help Harris win the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania. Trump managed to flip the Keystone State, as well as the other key blue wall battleground states of Wisconsin and Michigan, which were crucial for Harris' hopes of election victory. 'I know a lot of people are probably wondering tonight what would have happened had Shapiro been on the ticket,' Li, who is also Pennsylvania commissioner, told Fox News. 'And not only in terms of Pennsylvania. He's famously a moderate. So that would have signaled to the American people that she is not the San Francisco liberal that Trump said she was.' 'In the eyes of the American people, [Walz] was the governor who oversaw the [George Floyd] protests in Minnesota and probably let it go on longer than he should have. So that has been seared in the minds of the American people,' she added. Li also said Harris made a mistake during her appearance on ABC's The View in October. When the vice president was asked what she would have done differently over the past four years compared to
2024110710342	Biden, she replied: 'Not a thing comes to mind.' Li told Fox News: 'That was the opener for her to show Americans that she's going to get tough on the border, that she's going to take drastic measures to bring down inflation. That was her chance.' Others also suggested Harris failed to distance herself enough from Biden and attempt to offer a change of direction for the country going forward. Biden was considered an unpopular president among voters who spent months seeking reelection despite concerns about the 81-year-old's ability to run for a second term in office. By the time Biden ended his 2024 bid and endorsed Harris, the vice president had around 100 days to convince voters to support her own campaign. 'We ran the best campaign we could, considering Joe Biden was president,' one unnamed Harris aide told Politico. 'Joe Biden is the singular reason Kamala Harris and Democrats lost.' Massachusetts Representative Seth Moulton, who was one of the first Democrats to urge Biden to end his reelection bid after the president's disastrous CNN debate performance, said it 'would have been better' if Harris had taken part and won the 2024 Democratic primary. '[I]t was necessary for the Democratic nominee to separate him or herself from an unpopular incumbent, as much as we love Joe Biden,' Moulton told Politico. 'None of those things happened.' Jamal Simmons, the vice president's former communications director, said Harris fully breaking from Biden for her campaign would have been a 'trap' and seized upon as another Republican attack line. 'You can't really run away from the president who chooses you,' Simmons told the BBC. MSNBC's Joy Reid defended Harris, suggesting the vice president had a 'historic flawlessly run' campaign which included the endorsement of several high-profile celebrities such as Taylor Swift and Beyonce. 'You could not have run a better campaign in that short period of time,' Reid said. Harris formally conceded the election to Trump during a speech at Howard University in Washington, D.C, on Wednesday, urging her supporters 'do not despair' at the results. 'This is not a time to throw up our hands. This is a time to roll up our sleeves,' Harris said. 'This is a time to organize, to mobilize and to stay engaged for the sake of freedom and justice and the future that we all know we can build together.'

2024110620231	Kamala Harris of the Democrat party has 67,951,111 votes (47.5%) Donald Trump of the Republican party has 72,658,972 votes (50.8%) Kamala Harris is preparing to speak to the US public later on Wednesday after calling Donald Trump to congratulate him on his election victory. The defeated Democrat spoke to her rival on Wednesday afternoon and they discussed 'the importance of a peaceful transfer of power and being a president for all Americans', a Harris aide told journalists. Harris cancelled her expected election night appearance at Howard University in Washington DC, as her prospects of victory began to recede. The current vice-president is now expected to speak at the venue at 16:00 EST (21:00 GMT). She did not concede on election night, despite it becoming clear by the early hours of Wednesday that her Republican rival had secured enough votes in key swing states to win. Trump has now won enough key battleground states, including Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Wisconsin, to secure the presidency, with several states left to declare. Trump is also beating Harris in the popular vote - the first Republican to lead nationally since George W Bush in 2004. In a statement, Trump described his victory as one 'our country has never seen before'. 'I will fight for you, for your family, and your future. Every single day I will be fighting for you with every breath in my body,' he told voters. He vowed to 'unlock America's glorious destiny' and promised his presidency would deliver 'the golden age of America'. As expected, Trump stormed to victory in conservative strongholds across the US, while Harris won liberal states from New York to California. Harris saw a surge in popularity after she became the Democratic Party's nominee in June following Joe Biden's disastrous performance in the first presidential debate. Her team sought to strike a more optimistic vision than the portrait of American decay presented by Trump, focusing heavily on securing abortion rights. Trump, by contrast, frequently targeted Harris with highly personal attacks during the campaign, variously calling the vice-president 'stupid', 'lazy', and 'dumb as a rock'. He also questioned her racial identity during the early stages of the campaign. In a message to staff, Harris' campaign chair, Jen O'Malley Dillion, said losing the election was 'unfathomably hard' and will take a 'long time to process'. 'But the work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump presidency starts now,' she said in an email obtained by the BBC's US partner, CBS News. 'I know the vice president isn't finished in this fight, and I know the very people on this email are also going to be leaders in this collective mission.' The former California senator was running to become the first woman, black woman and South Asian-American to win the presidency. Exit poll data suggests that the Democratic nominee may have under-performed with women. Some 54% of female voters cast their ballots for her, below the 57% of women Joe Biden won in 2020. Black and Latino voters also appeared slightly less likely to support Harris than they were to back Biden four years ago, exit poll data suggested. The campaign faced criticism at times for its failure to expand on a clear economic message, an issue which was extremely important to Americans who have faced several years of rising inflation. About 86 million voters cast their ballots early during one of the most turbulent campaigns in recent American history. The Republican party enjoyed a resurgence across the country, winning a number of key congressional
2024110620232	battles in key states and taking back control of the Senate. The Republicans wrested two seats in West Virginia and Ohio from the Democrats and saw off a stiff challenge in Texas. Neither party seemed to have an overall edge in the House, which Republicans narrowly control. If the party does regain control of both chambers, it would make it easier for Trump to push through his agenda - which includes mass deportations of illegal migrants and sweeping tax cuts.

2024110707041	The vice president set the tone for how Democrats can responsibly resist in the coming four years. Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a crisp concession speech on Wednesday afternoon at Howard University. The 60-year-old acknowledged, with grace, dignity and a dash of hope, that she had lost the presidency to former president Donald Trump. She didn't make excuses. Instead, she set the tone for how Democrats can responsibly approach Mr. Trump in the coming four years - defending their core values while cooperating for the best interests of the country. 'While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign,' she said, citing freedom and dignity for all Americans as the aspirations that guided her effort. She offered a counterpoint to the worst-case scenarios circulating on the political left, to the effect that this was the last election of a doomed democracy. Most important, she promised to assist in a peaceful transition of power. Subscribe to comment and get the full experience. Choose your plan
2024110617291	While recognizing the necessity of the ongoing and incoming thrilling and exhaustive analysis about the 2024 presidential contest and why it ended the way it did, what went wrong or right, who was or was not to blame, who did or didn't do this or that, the crises and disasters of everyone's pressing personalized post mortem, I would like to very humbly thank Kamala Harris for running for President of our great country and distinguishing herself - in my judgment - as a courageous leader. Vice President Harris delivered in many significant ways on the trail, from her rousing speech at the Democratic National Convention, to her lawyerly and expert prosecution of her opponent in their single debate, to her genuine efforts to connect with voters in the great City of Brotherly Love and elsewhere. She made the hard decisions, maybe not all of them the most politically pragmatic. But she ran the hard race. I believe she gave of herself with a true fighter's pride, with honor, and that her belief in America shone through in her words and deeds. I am proud that this American woman from my generation, Gen X - finely trained and educated and with real demonstrable character and deep civilizing formation - stepped into the breach as she did and made what I believe to have been an exemplary and urgent case for the country. I do not claim membership in either party, mostly because I cherish the value of independence, and am fixated on the precision of our language in a way that prevents me from committing to what I hear as the confining preconditions of party-speak. In addition, I learned a long time ago as a beat reporter in Wyoming to serve the readers, not a party. But I respect the real leaders in both parties and the people who see them as the imperfect vehicles for political endeavor. In this case, with the stakes of the ideals of our beloved nation clear to me, and deficiencies admittedly rampant on both sides as we painfully do less than fully strive to realize those ideals for everyone, I saw Vice President Harris as a strong choice for the White House. In her short time on the trail, she proved a worthy leader, prepared, hard-nosed, and hard-working, with a real sense of the law at the core of our brilliant system of government and an exacting prosecutorial toughness. I want to thank her for running, and for representing my generation with dignity, decency, and grace, a blessing, I think, within the ongoing blessing that it is to wake up in this world as an American. Vox Populi. Vox Dei. Click here for the full Insider Index Thank you Kamala ! The boys handed her an uphill battle. Too bad the country still does not value a strong and capable woman- when at first you don't succeed - try try again!! This time we have no choice but to keep trying to make the world better! Thank you, Max, for a truly elegant piece. Thank you Vice President Harris for your heart felt efforts in this presidential race.

Thank you Kamala for standing tall and showing our youth another way to be! She was bullied, attacked and denigrated but always took the high road. She was an exemplar of 'statesmanship'' A great campaign in 107 days! We can't thank you enough for having the courage to sound the trumpet for unity. Madam Vice President, you are a beacon of hope that
2024110617292	democracy can prevail. Thank you so much for your efforts. I wish Americans were not so stuck in the past. Good luck in your future endeavors. History repeats itself.

2024110704571	We're following the latest election results in D.C., Maryland and Virginia, plus former President Donald Trump's win. Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to speak to supporters at Howard University at 4 p.m. Wednesday. Follow live updates below. Former President Donald Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in the race to the White House, NBC News projects. He claimed victory after winning Wisconsin, boosting him to 276 electoral votes. Trump's victory makes him the first incoming president to have been indicted and convicted of felony charges, after his hush-money trial in New York. He will gain the power to end other federal investigations pending against him. Trump also becomes only the second president in history to win non-consecutive White House terms, after Grover Cleveland in the late-19th century. In this second term, Trump will be America's 47th president. Democrat Eugene Vindman won Virginia's most competitive congressional race Wednesday, defeating his opponent in a blow to the GOP's hopes of flipping the open House seat, the Associated Press reports. NBC News has yet to project a winner in the race. In Virginia's 7th District, Vindman defeated Republican Derrick Anderson by a close margin after conservatives targeted the House seat. Democratic U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the district's three-term incumbent, decided to run for governor in 2025 - presenting an opening in the battleground district. Vindman, despite being a political newcomer, developed a national profile after blowing the whistle alongside his brother during then-President Donald Trump's first impeachment. The former Army officer focused his campaign on abortion rights and the threat of MAGA extremism on democracy. Anderson, a fellow veteran and former Green Beret, pitched himself as the more affable candidate, and centered his campaign on the economy. The election between Vindman and Anderson quickly became one of the most competitive in the country, with Republicans hoping to make gains in districts in which they don't face an incumbent. The acrimonious race was filled with insults and barbs. Read Full Article Mayor Muriel Bowser's team has been bracing for a second Donald Trump term that makes good on the former president's threats to 'take over' D.C. While on the campaign trail, Trump threatened a federal takeover of D.C. Any president of the United States has enormous power when it comes to D.C. because it's not a state. The president can take over the police department and many of the powers the mayor and D.C. Council have. Trump made the District, whose residents are overwhelmingly Democrats, a target in his re-election campaign. 'We will take over the horribly run capital of our nation in Washington, D.C., and clean it up, renovate it and rebuild our capital city so there is no longer a nightmare of murder and crime,' Trump said while campaigning in Florida over the summer. 'But, rather, it will become the most beautiful capital anywhere in the world. Right now, if you leave Florida - let's go, darling. Let's look at the Jefferson Memorial, let's look at the Washington Monument. Let's go and look at some of the beautiful scenes, and you end up getting shot, mugged, raped.' During a separate campaign stop, Trump said: 'And we're going to take it away from the mayor. And, again, that doesn't make me popular there, but I have to say it.' D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has publicly commented for the first time on President-elect Donald Trump's win. In a statement, she said she'll support the transition process and continue to advance the
2024110704572	priorities of the District. In a post on X, Bowser said: 'As the nation's capital, we are proud to fulfill our role in the peaceful transition of power. We will actively support the incoming Trump Administration's transition process and the 60th Presidential Inauguration of President-elect Trump. As your mayor, I have worked with three presidents, including President-elect Trump, and congressional leaders of both parties to advance the priorities of the District - infrastructure, housing affordability, downtown revitalization and our self-determination. And driven by our values, we will pursue a collaborative approach to our federal priorities in the District.' Her statement concluded: 'We thank the DC Board of Elections and election officials across the country for conducting a free and fair election. And we congratulate DC councilmembers and commissioners, members of Congress and President-elect Trump on their victories.' Supporters react as Vice President Kamala Harris concedes the election during a speech at Howard University. The vice president used part of her concession speech from her alma mater's campus to address younger voters. 'To the young people who are watching,' Harris said, prompting a roar from the audience at Howard, 'it is OK to feel sad and disappointed, but please know that it's going to be OK.' 'On the campaign, I would often say, 'When we fight, we win,'' Harris told the crowd, many of them in tears. 'But here's the thing: Sometime the fight takes a while. That doesn't mean we won't win. That doesn't mean we won't win. The important thing is don't ever give up, don't ever give up, don't ever stop trying to make the world a better place.' 'And don't you ever listen when anyone tells you something is impossible because it has never been done before,' she added. Harris delivered her concession speech from Howard University's campus. It's available to view in its entirety here: D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson says he supports the democratic process and a peaceful transition of power, 'even when we are unhappy with the results,' he wrote in a brief statement this afternoon. 'And despite our internal disagreements over how things could be better, we, the District of Columbia, have a very good city, financially sound, and well run. We will remain focused on our strengths, protect our autonomy, and make sure no one tries to take that away from us,' his statement concluded. An audience at Howard University chanted Kamala Harris' name as she took the stage to publicly concede the presidential race to Trump. Harris said she spoke to the president-elect earlier today and emphasized a peaceful transfer of power. And she remained resolute in her bid for president. 'While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign,' she said. Kamala Harris conceded to Donald Trump in a speech at Howard University and said she will help Trump enact a peaceful transfer of power. 'The light of America's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting,' she said. Harris said, 'This is not a time to throw up our hands; it's a time to roll up our sleeves.' She spoke about her ongoing commitment to the ideals of the United States and finding unity as Americans. WASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 06: Supporters wait to hear Democratic presidential nominee, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris speak on stage as she is expected to concede the election, at Howard University on November 06, 2024 in Washington, DC. After a contentious campaign focused on key battleground states, the
2024110704573	Republican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump was projected to secure the majority of electoral votes, giving him a second term as U.S. President. Republicans also secured control of the Senate for the first time in four years. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images) Vice President Kamala Harris has arrived at Howard University and will concede the race for the presidency to President-elect Donald Trump. Her speech to the American people will end a historic, 100-day dash to become the 47th President of the U.S., which began after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July. A large crowd is waiting at the campaign staging area on Howard's campus. She is expected to speak shortly after 4 p.m. President Biden spoke with both Harris and Trump by phone Wednesday afternoon, the White House said. Biden congratulated the vice president on her historic campaign. In his call to President-elect Trump, Biden congratulated him, the White House said. Biden 'emphasized the importance of working to bring the country together,' and said he was committed to ensuring a smooth transition, according to the White House. Staff for Biden and Trump plan to coordinate a specific date for the two to meet at the White House in the near future. Biden is expected to address the nation Thursday to discuss the election results and the transition between presidents. What changed for Trump between the 2020 and 2024 elections? NBC News, in conjunction with a consortium of news organizations, conducted exit polls across 10 key states both at polling locations and over the phone. Those states are Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin. One of the largest shifts was among Hispanic voters - particularly Hispanic men. In 2020, 32% of Hispanic voters went for Trump, the data says. In 2024, Trump won 45% of Hispanic voters. Trump also won over a larger share of voters between the ages of 18 and 29, counting 36% in 2020 and 42% in 2024. Check out all the data here. Workers continued construction of a platform outside the U.S. Capitol for Inauguration Day. Here's a look at their progress on Wednesday, after Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election and became president-elect. Justice Department officials have been evaluating how to wind down the two federal criminal cases against President-elect Donald Trump before he takes office to comply with longstanding department policy that a sitting president can't be prosecuted, two people familiar with the matter tell NBC News. The latest discussions stand in contrast with the pre-election legal posture of special counsel Jack Smith, who in recent weeks took significant steps in the election interference case against Trump without regard to the electoral calendar. But the sources say DOJ officials have come to grips with the fact that no trial is possible any time soon in either the Jan. 6 case or the classified documents matter - both of which are mired in legal issues that would likely prompt an appeal all the way to the Supreme Court, even if Trump had lost the election. Now that Trump will become president again, DOJ officials see no room to pursue either criminal case against him - and no point in continuing to litigate them in the weeks before he takes office, the people said. Get the full story here. Vice President Kamala Harris called President-elect Donald Trump to congratulate him on winning the 2024 presidential election, according to a senior Harris aide. Harris discussed the importance of a peaceful transfer of power and being
2024110704574	a president for all Americans, the aide said. Two other Harris aides also said Harris spent the morning and afternoon working on her concession speech, which she will deliver at 4 p.m. at D.C.'s Howard University. One of those aides said Harris' team before today had spent very little time working on a concession or victory speech. Instead, the Harris team had spent the bulk of their time creating a speech that would tell people to 'hold on' because they expected the race results to be uncertain at this time in the week.

Prior to the 2024 election, American University history professor Allan Lichtman had correctly predicted 9 out of the past 10 presidential elections since 1984, NBC News reported. He incorrectly predicted Kamala Harris would win the 2024 presidential race and said on X on Wednesday that he will discuss on Thursday why he got it wrong. 'I admit that I was wrong. I will assess the election and the keys on my live show this Thursday at 9 PM Eastern,' he said. Jeff Bezos, the billionaire Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post, congratulated President-elect Donald Trump on his 'extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory.' 'Big congratulations to our 45th and now 47th President on an extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory. No nation has bigger opportunities. Wishing @realDonaldTrump all success in leading and uniting the America we all love,' he said in a post on X. Bezos drew intense criticism in recent weeks after his newspaper declined to endorse a presidential candidate this year and decided to stop making presidential endorsements altogether. The billionaire businessman, who acquired the newspaper in 2013, defended the move as an attempt to combat perceptions of media bias and restore trust among readers. 'We are in trouble. We're just in trouble,' one woman said in downtown D.C. Wednesday morning after election night and President-elect Donald Trump's victory. Another voter said: 'We've lived through him before. I think we will survive through this one, but I'm very disappointed.' News4 spoke with people downtown as boards were removed from the windows of a CVS on K Street NW. Boards on other windows downtown remained up on Wednesday morning. After heightened security and fears of possible violence, D.C. police told News4 they made no arrests overnight. The prospect of a second Trump presidency was met with excitement at events across the U.S., including outside Trump Tower in New York City on election night. A stretch of Georgia Avenue NW near Howard University is shut down again as Kamala Harris is expected to address the nation Wednesday at 4 p.m. Georgia Avenue is closed between V and Harvard streets NW, D.C. police said. Several other streets around Howard remain shut down after Harris hosted her election night watch party on the campus. Georgia Avenue had reopened for several hours on Wednesday morning. Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to deliver a speech to the country and her supporters at 4 p.m. at Howard University, her alma mater, a campaign aide confirmed to NBC News. She is expected to officially concede the 2024 presidential election to Donald Trump. Harris and President Joe Biden also plan to call Trump Wednesday to congratulate him. Read more. Vice President-elect JD Vance turned to X to thank his wife, President-elect Donald Trump and his supporters after Trump won the presidential election. Vance, a resident of Alexandria's Del Ray neighborhood,
2024110704575	wrote: 'THANK YOU! To my beautiful wife for making it possible to do this. To President Donald J. Trump, for giving me such an opportunity to serve our country at this level. And to the American people, for their trust. I will never stop fighting for ALL of you.' The Ohio senator is expected to move into the vice president's residence in Northwest D.C., on the grounds of the United States Naval Observatory - Vice President Kamala Harris' current home. Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley celebrated Trump's White House return and said his side of the aisle 'is Donald Trump's party.' Whatley called Tuesday night's victory a 'fundamental realignment of American politics' with 'a historic shift with Black voters, with Asian voters, with Hispanic voters.' 'We are very happy that there is going to be a focus on America and there's going to be a focus on American families,' Whatley told Fox News. Exit polls showed Trump made big strides with Latino voters, who went 53% to 45% to Harris after going 66-32 for Biden four years ago. Black voters remained generally loyal to the Democratic ticket (86-12 for Harris, 87-12 for Biden) but was a smaller share of the total vote in 2024 versus 2020, down to 11% from 13%. A Michigan man who showed up to the visitors' center of the U.S. Capitol on Election Day smelling like fuel and carrying a torch and a flare gun also brought an apparent manifesto about war in the Middle East, police say. Austin M. Olson, 28, of Westland, Michigan, is charged with possession of a prohibited weapon, unlawful activities and disorderly conduct, U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) said Wednesday morning. USCP said Olson was in the process of going through security at the Capitol Visitor Center about 12:30 p.m. when officers discovered the torch and flare gun in his jacket. Police also found 'what appears to be a manifesto' and a letter to Congress about the suspect's opinions on war in the Middle East, USCP said. Police did not elaborate on what the letter said, and the agency is still trying to figure out why Olson showed up at the Capitol with those items, USCP said. Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said that as of Wednesday morning, the president-elect has not received any kind of call from Harris or Biden. Here's how cities, counties and congressional districts in the DMV voted. Choose which race you're interested in at the top, then click a district to zoom in. Republican Derrick Anderson said that there are 'thousands of outstanding ballots to count' in Virginia's 7th Congressional District in a statement on X. 'Simply put, like so many other races across the country, this race remains too close to call,' Anderson said on X. 'And like many other races across the country, it has not been called by any major media outlet.' His opponent Democrat Eugene Vindman declared victory in the critical 7th Congressional District. According to Anderson's statement, a local media outlet misreported a false race call Tuesday night, 'causing a considerable amount of confusion and misreporting.' NBC News has not declared a winner in the race, and Republican Derrick Anderson has not conceded. Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to deliver a speech to the country and her supporters at her alma mater Howard University, a campaign co-chair confirmed to NBC News. Her election night watch party was held at Howard Tuesday night. The campus served as a headquarters, and Harris had hoped to make a victory speech there. Although she did not speak to her supporters on election night, her campaign co-chair promised she
2024110704576	would speak on Wednesday. 'But you will hear from her tomorrow because she will be back here tomorrow to address not only the HU family, not only to address her supporters but to address the nation,' campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond said. The speech comes after President-Elect Donald Trump gained victory in the election results. University of Maryland government and politics professor Breanna Gray spoke with News4 on Wednesday morning about what took President-elect Donald Trump over the edge to win the presidency again. Gray pointed to three factors she said stood out: the gender divide, the rural/urban divide and the composition of voters racially. 'In a lot of these cases, we're seeing that the rural/urban divide really was a telling story about Democratic losses,' she said. Trump had an advantage with Latino men and young white men. Stay with News4 for video showing Gray's remarks. Howard University's The Yard was left empty after Vice President Kamala Harris' election night watch party held on Tuesday night.

Former President Donald Trump claimed victory in remarks to supporters after winning critical swing states. 'Look what happened. Is this crazy?' He said hours before NBC News projected him to retake the White House. National civil rights organizations from the NAACP to the ACLU have spoken out against Project 2025 and the sweeping changes the document proposes for the federal government. They also warn that the policies outlined
2024110704577	in the document would have a disproportionate effect on African Americans. The nation's largest population of wealthy Black people live in the DMV, especially in Prince George's County and Charles County. Many of the region's middle-class and upper-middle-class Black families have been built around federal work, and the government is the area's largest employer. The document lays out the return of former President Donald Trump's Schedule F executive order, which was reversed by President Joe Biden. It would strip job protections from career officials in policy roles, make it easier to fire civil servants and require loyalty to the president. Though former Trump officials helped craft Project 2025 and the plan praises Trump's administration, the former president has distanced himself from it.

Stay up-to-date on reporting that amplifies the stories, voices, and perspectives of Black America. Word In Black A groundbreaking collaboration of 10 legendary Black news publishers. When I got to the Wheaton station for the Metro, Washington, D.C.'s subway system, at a quarter past 5 last Tuesday, I realized I was going to be late. Granted, the event I was headed to was just a 30-minute ride away, and wouldn't start for two hours. But I was headed to Vice President Kamala Harris's rally at the Ellipse, a park just south of the White House. I'd been reading the signs, about how the crowds at her rallies had been growing by the week, a clear sign that something was happening. RELATED: How Michelle Obama Sparked My Drive to Turn Out the Vote It's a week later, it's Election Day - and I'm still thinking about that rally. Folks are nervous about who America will vote into office, Donald Trump and his Project 2025 agenda, or Kamala Harris and her clear agenda for America's future. That rally was the first time I really felt that Kamala Harris will win this. Stay up-to-date on reporting that amplifies the stories, voices, and perspectives of Black America. I've been cautiously excited about her jumping into the race ever since late summer, when she replaced President Joe BIden at the top of the presidential ticket. I was one of the 47,000 brothers who joined the first Win With Black Men fundraising call (though I was disappointed that we raised $500,000 less than Win With Black Women, even with more people on our call.). RELATED: It's Time to Get on the Right Side of History Back then, though, I also was fatalistic, like every other Black person whom America had let down, ignored or betrayed. Trump seemed literally bulletproof after two assassination attempts, the Democrats' elevation of Harris was a huge gamble on an untested candidate and the nation had already shown it didn't want a qualified female president - let alone a Black woman who pledged Alpha Kappa Alpha at Howard University. And as a Black man, I kept hearing how we would pull a Stacy Abrams on Harris and vanish on Election Day. Or that we would vote for the convicted felon with the gold, $200 kicks because we can relate. RELATED: Kamala Harris Has a Plan for Black Men. Trump Never Did Hope sputtered to life, though, after Harris smashed Trump during their first and only debate. It flickered as she ran a flawless presidential campaign on a much shorter runway than Trump, who's been running for eight years. It grew when she crushed it at the Democratic National Convention, pulled even with Trump, then stayed in the groove while Trump lost steam heading into November. Now, on my way to the rally, my reporter's instinct told me there would be a mob scene. Going against rush-hour subway traffic, more people kept crowding onto the train as it got closer to the White House, and disgorged nearly all of them just blocks away from the rally. RELATED: How Will Project 2025 Affect Black America? On the street, the crowd grew heavier as I approached the corner of F and 15th streets. I braced myself as I turned the corner to what purportedly was the entrance two blocks from the rally. And then I was stunned. The street was a river filled, curb to curb, with people. Three or four orderly lines wound a quarter mile down the street. And the racial composition looked like a Benneton ad had mutated: Black, white, Asian, young, old, students, businesspeople, artists. RELATED: A Love
2024110520342	Letter to My Daughter: A Vote for Your Future A man with an electric guitar, speaker, and backing vocals sang soul ballads. A dude on a bicycle - wearing a Harris/Walz T-shirt and a full-face monkey mask, for some reason - raced back and forth, weaving in and out of the lines. There was a bootleg Elmo, scooting around on an electric unicycle. Lots of Harris/Walz camouflage baseball caps. I'd been shuffling in my line for about an hour when some quick mental calculations led me to conclude I probably wasn't going to get into the main venue. By then, the overflow section stretched a good 100 yards from the entrance across the street to the base of the Washington Monument. Word went around that there were 75,000 people in the crowd. It felt like twice that. After wedging my way through the thick crowd and interviewing about a half-dozen people - including Black women, who among the most skeptical that Americans would vote for someone who looked like them - I realized the good vibes were legit. They truly believed in Harris. That's when I began to believe that joy could triumph over fear; that positivity might actually overcome pessimism and doubt. Black women, I thought, can and should be seen. And whenever democracy needs rescuing, we instinctively look to them for the job. The polls close in mere hours, and we might not know the results of the election tonight. But what I saw at that rally will forever remind me of comedian Trevor Noah's shout-out to his mother and grandmother on his final broadcast of 'The Daily Show': 'Unlike everybody else, Black women can't afford to f- around and find out.'

2024110701071	Vice President Kamala Harris conceded her defeat in an address supporters Wednesday afternoon at Howard University, her alma mater in Washington, D.C. 'When we lose an election, we accept the results,' Harris told the crowd, drawing an implicit contrast to former President Donald Trump, who refused to commit to accepting the election's outcome. Harris called Trump earlier on Wednesday, conceding the historic election after a hard-fought race for the right to lead the nation. She discussed the importance of a peaceful transfer of power and being a president for all Americans with Trump, according to a senior Harris aide. Foes of Trump, meanwhile, promised to provide his administration no honeymoon. Hours after Trump's victory, advocacy groups were setting their sights on the president-elect, who will take office Jan. 20. The American Civil Liberties Union, which fought many controversial Trump policies during his first administration, said Wednesday that it already has a battle plan and would take action 'the minute he takes the oath of office.' Sign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team. Kris Brown, president of the gun-safety group Brady, called Trump's election 'troubling' but pledged to continue the fight to prevent gun violence: 'Even though we won't have a friend in the White House, Brady isn't giving up an inch.' Sierra Club Executive Director Ben Jealous called Trump's first term a 'disaster for climate progress' and pledged to 'challenge Trump's dangerous proposals in court (and) keep the pressure on banks and big corporations to clean up their act.' Those advocacy groups will be facing a president whose party could emerge with majorities in the the House and Senate. GOP candidates picked up several pivotal Senate seats, including in West Virginia and Ohio, to seize control of the Senate. Results were still coming in for dozens of tightly contested House seats, but Speaker Mike Johnson issued a statement saying the 'latest data and trends indicate that when all the votes are tabulated, Republicans will have held our majority.' Keep up with the USA TODAY Network's live coverage of the presidential election and downballot fights. President Joe Biden on Wednesday called President-elect Donald Trump to congratulate him on his election victory and invited him to a meeting at the White House during the presidential transition period - an invitation which Trump did not extend to him just four years ago. Biden's outreach to Trump isn't necessarily unusual - outgoing presidents traditionally meet with their successors before the formal inauguration. But it comes after Trump refused to extend a similar invitation to Biden during the 2020 presidential election. Trump also promoted fraudulent claims that the election was stolen and skipped Biden's inauguration. 'President Biden expressed his commitment to ensuring a smooth transition and emphasized the importance of working to bring the country together,' the White House said in a statement about the phone call. Trump Campaign Spokesperson Steven Cheung confirmed the call, saying in a statement that 'President Trump looks forward to the meeting, which will take place shortly, and very much appreciated the call.' The White House has yet to be set a date for Trump and Biden's encounter. Biden plans to address the country on Thursday to discuss the presidential transition efforts. - Karissa Waddick WASHINGTON Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday he spoke with President-elect Donald Trump and congratulated him on his decisive election win as the Ukrainian
2024110701072	leader seeks continued U.S. support for his country's war against Russia. Zelenskyy, in a post on X, said he had an 'excellent call' with Trump and 'congratulated him on his historic landslide victory,' adding that 'his tremendous campaign made this result possible.' 'I praised his family and team for their great work,' Zelenskyy said. 'We agreed to maintain close dialogue and advance our cooperation. Strong and unwavering U.S. leadership is vital for the world and for a just peace.' The Biden administration has pumped billions of dollars in military support into Ukraine two and a half years after Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of the neighboring country. But future U.S. aid for Ukraine is in doubt after the election of Trump, who has a history of flattering statements about Putin and would not say during a September presidential debate whether he wants Ukraine to win the war. -Joey Garrison Former House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., issued a statement Wednesday acknowledging Trump's victory and committing to a peaceful transfer of power. 'We all pray for America's success under the next Administration,' she said. 'The peaceful transfer of power is the cornerstone of our democracy. After every election, we all have a responsibility to come together and find common ground.' - Riley Beggin Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-V.T., blasted the Democratic Party for its presidential and Senate election losses on Tuesday night, arguing that it had moved away from its roots supporting America's middle and lower class. 'It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them,' said Sanders, the most prominent progressive lawmaker in Congress. He mentioned concerns about access to healthcare, automation eliminating blue-collar jobs and the war in Israel. The strong rebuke comes after Sanders endorsed President Joe Biden, and then Vice President Kamala Harris as the party's nominee earlier this year. When Harris unveiled her economic plan earlier this year, Sanders said he was 'impressed,' and called it 'an excellent start.' Sanders did not mention either Harris or Biden in his statement, instead targeting it at the party's infrastructure. 'Will the big money interests and well-paid consultants who control the Democratic Party learn any real lessons from this disastrous campaign?' Sanders questioned. 'Do they have any ideas as to how we can take on the increasingly powerful Oligarchy which has so much economic and political power? Probably not.' - Karissa Waddick Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday conceded the 2024 election, promising a peaceful transfer of power. 'The outcome is not what we hoped for, worked for or voted for, but the light of America's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting,' Harris said during a concession speech at Howard University, her alma mater, in Washington, D.C. 'The fight for our country is always worth it.' 'I am so proud of the campaign we ran,' Harris told the crowd, to enthusiastic applause. Harris called on young people to continue to fight to make the 'world a better place' while vowing to continue her fight for the freedoms she laid out during her campaign, including abortion rights and gun control. 'While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign,' she said. 'We will continue to wage this fight in the voting booth, in the courts and in the public square, and we will also wage it in quieter ways, in how we live
2024110701073	our lives, by treating one another with kindness and respect.' 'Do not despair,' she added. 'This is a time to mobilize.' When Harris said the country may be entering a dark period, a smattering of attendees responded, 'We are.' Trump was announced the winner of the 2024 presidential election in the early hours of Wednesday morning, sweeping many of the key swing states and widening his support among young men, Black men and Hispanic voters to prevail. As attendees filtered out, younger Harris supporters and staffers shed tears as her time as a candidate came to a close. - Rebecca Morin and Francesca Chambers President Joe Biden called Trump earlier in the day to congratulate the former president on his victory in the 2024 presidential race. He also invited Trump to meet with him in the White House. The staff will coordinate a specific date in the near future, the White House said. In a stunning political comeback, the former president won all seven battleground states on the road to 270 electoral votes, capturing a decisive victory against Harris. The vice president will be delivering remarks at Howard University at 4 p.m., the White House said. Harris also called Trump to congratulate him, according to a senior Harris aide. -Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy and Sudiksha Kochi Harris campaign senior adviser David Plouffe called the vice president's loss to Donald Trump 'devastating' and pointed to a 'deep hole' Harris faced after she replaced Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee. 'It was a privilege to spend the last 100 days with Kamala Harris,' Plouffe said in a post on X, commending the 'amazing staff' led by campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon 'who left it on the field for their country.' 'We dug out of a deep hole but not enough. A devastating loss. Thanks for being in the arena, all of you,' Plouffe said. Plouffe, who worked as President Barack Obama's campaign manager in 2008, was among a group of former Obama staffers tapped for top campaign leadership positions after Harris secured the Democratic nomination. Harris mounted a condensed 108-day campaign that ultimately fell well short of victory. -Joey Garrison Former President George W. Bush congratulated Donald Trump and JD Vance on their win and thanked Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for their service to the country in a statement Wednesday morning. 'The strong turnout in this election is a sign of the health of our republic and the strength of our democratic institutions,' Bush said. 'We join our fellow citizens in praying for the success of our new leaders at all levels of government. The former Republican president did not endorse either Trump or Harris in the election. His daughter, Barbara Bush, knocked doors for the Harris campaign in Pennsylvania and his vice president, Dick Cheney, endorsed the Democratic candidate. - Karissa Waddick President-elect Donald Trump's victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in Tuesday's election marked the end of a long, divisive campaign that will see the Republican return to the White House just four years after voters ejected him from the job. With the campaign behind him, Trump can now turn his attention to putting together a cabinet and a staff to carry out his agenda. A familiar cast of characters - some of whom had jobs in his first administration - stand ready to serve. Others like the many who officials from his first administration who subsequently questioned his fitness for office not so much. Here's a look at who's in and who isn't. -Michael Collins The controversial conservative playbook Project 2025, a highly criticized
2024110701074	'presidential transition project' created by the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation, could draw intense interest when the Trump administration takes power in January. Harris attempted to tie the former president to the 900-page document that outlines extreme policy positions, such as limiting abortion access and mass deportation, that project supporters hope Trump will implement. Trump has repeatedly distanced himself from the project, claiming in a July Truth Social post to 'know nothing about Project 2025' despite many of the project's creators having close ties to the previous Trump administration. Cybele Mayes-Osterman and Sam Woodward Harris will address supporters at Howard University in Washington, tentatively at 4 p.m. ET, a source familiar with the plans confirmed. She is expected to formally concede the race. Harris had been set to publicly address her followers at an election night party at Howard, her alma mater, but the vice president stayed at her residence as her path to victory narrowed. Trump secured the 270 electoral votes needed to become the next president after he was projected the winner of Wisconsin around 5:40 a.m. ET. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Wednesday that the narrowly divided House appears set to remain in Republican control, which he credited to widespread support for secure borders and reducing inflation. The House will participate in a unified GOP government with the Senate and White House after victories in critical swing districts in Michigan and Pennsylvania, Johnson said. 'The latest data and trends indicate that when all the votes are tabulated, Republicans will have held our majority, even though we faced a map with 18 Biden-won seats,' Johnson said in a statement. 'I look forward to working with President Trump and a Republican Senate to deliver as speaker of the House on the mandate entrusted to us by the American people.' Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Wednesday that he plans to clear out 'entire departments' at the Food and Drug Administration if he has the capacity to do so in the next Trump administration. 'I can get the corruption out of the agencies,' Kennedy said in an interview with MSNBC. 'That's what I've been doing for 40 years. I've sued all those agencies. I have a Ph.D. in corporate corruption.' The president-elect thanked Kennedy, who suspended his independent presidential campaign to endorse Trump, during his victory speech. Last week, Kennedy said Trump 'promised' him control of U.S. health agencies, but a member of the Trump transition team refuted that. 'He's going to help make America healthy again,' Trump said about Kennedy early Wednesday morning. 'He wants to do some things, and we're gonna let him go to it.' Rachel Barber Jeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon and owner of The Washington Post, congratulated president-elect Trump on his victory over Harris on Wednesday. 'Big congratulations to our 45th and now 47th President on an extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory. No nation has bigger opportunities' Bezos wrote in a post on X Wednesday morning. 'Wishing @realDonaldTrump all success in leading and uniting the America we all love.' The good wishes come a week after Bezos defended the Post's decision not to issue an endorsement of either presidential candidate - a move that broke with decades of tradition and led to resignations of multiple members of the editorial board as well as the cancellation of over 200,000 digital subscriptions, NPR reported. The editorial board had intended to endorse Harris before Bezos made the
2024110701075	decision to nix presidential endorsements, according to the Post. In an opinion article, Bezos defended the move, arguing it would help restore public trust by ending a practice he says creates a 'perception of non-independence' and bias. Chris Cann Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell congratulated Trump on his victory in the presidential race on Wednesday, telling reporters at the Capitol that he commended the former president for 'running a sharper operation this time.' McConnell, who's been the minority leader of the Senate since 2021 and will be stepping down from his leadership role this month, also said that he 'had really hoped I'd be able to hand over to my successor, the majority.' 'Based on the fact that we haven't got all the results, and we certainly already know we're going to be in the majority, we're hopeful that that might actually grow some,' he said. One of the most gratifying parts of Republicans having Senate control, McConnell said, is that the filibuster 'will stand.' 'There won't be any new states admitted to give a partisan advantage to the other side, and we'll quit beating up the Supreme Court every time we don't like a decision they make,' he said. So I think this shifting to a Republican Senate majority helps control the guardrails to keep people who want to change the rules in order to achieve something they think is worthwhile, not successful. And so I think the filibuster is very secure.' Sudiksha Kochi Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had a 'warm and cordial' conversation with President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday and was among the first world leaders to speak with him after his election victory. Netanyahu said they spoke about Israel's security and 'the Iranian threat.' Trump has long been close to Netanyahu and in his first term was widely viewed as one of the most pro-Israel U.S. presidents of modern times. Trump broke with years of U.S. policy when he moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which Palestinians also claim as their future capital. It's not immediately clear how Trump will deal the war in Gaza. Dozens of leaders and U.S. allies released statements expressing well wishes and congratulations after Trump won the election. Among them was Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose country is trying to determine whether Trump's White House will cut back on U.S. military aid for Ukraine or nudge it toward a peace deal with Russia. 'I appreciate President Trump's commitment to the 'peace through strength' approach in global affairs,' Zelenskyy said. 'This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer.' Kim Hjelmgaard Four years ago, Trump by most measures was a political pariah. Now he's a president in waiting. Rising from the ashes after a bonfire of scandal fueled by four criminal prosecutions, two impeachments and a failed insurrection, Trump swept aside dire warnings that he could bring American democracy to an end and instead used the democratic system as the ultimate vindication. Now he will become the second president in history the first since Grover Cleveland more than century ago to serve nonconsecutive terms. A politician rejected by voters in 2020 and abandoned by many in his party after the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Trump is poised to again become the most powerful man in the world. The convicted felon is now the incoming commander in chief. Weeks of polling had showed the candidates competing in a razor-close election, but in the end Trump won over enough pivotal states with his
2024110701076	focus on inflation and immigration. Harris won much of the West Coast and Northeast and Trump clinched victories in the South. But Trump also picked up North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, pushing him over the threshold of 270 electoral votes to win the race. Read more here on how Trump's historic comeback happened. Zac Anderson The election victory will delay and possibly wipe out Trump's four pending criminal cases, according to legal experts. Trump has made clear he would derail the efforts of Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith in his two federal cases. And action in two state cases in New York and Georgia are likely to be postponed until he is done serving in the White House. 'I think we are in uncharted territory,' said Alexander Reinert, a Cardozo School of Law professor, said of the state cases. Trump has said he could fire Smith or pardon himself. 'It's so easy I would fire him within two seconds,' Trump told radio host Hugh Hewitt on Oct. 24. What the election results mean for you: Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter for updates and exclusive analysis. The American Civil Liberties Union, which fought many of Donald Trump's controversial policies during his first administration, said Wednesday that it already has a plan for Trump's next term. The ACLU was the first group in 2017 to challenge Trump's ban on travel from predominantly Muslim countries, one of 434 legal actions it took against the first Trump administration. This time, Executive Director Anthony D. Romero said the ACLU is ready to fight Trump's vow to seek retribution against his enemies, to launch a 'mass deportation' of at least 11 million immigrants living in the United States without authorization and other promises. 'We are ready to take action the minute Trump takes the oath of office,' Romero said in a statement. 'When President-elect Trump targets immigrants, dissidents and his political opponents we will challenge him in the courts, in state legislatures and in the streets.' Vice president-elect JD Vance thanked supporters after he and Trump claimed victory early Wednesday morning. And his mother, Beverly Aikins, returned to Facebook on Wednesday to celebrate her son's win. Aikins took a break from social media in July after seeing 'vitriol and hate' toward her son, including from critics in Vance's hometown of Middletown, where she still lives. 'Too big to rig,' she wrote. 'Popular vote by more than five million. Two hundred seventy seven electoral votes and still counting. Trump Vance 2024.' Victoria Moorwood, Cincinnati Enquirer Bomb threats believed to be emanating from Russia interrupted voting Tuesday across numerous battleground states, but a top U.S. cybersecurity official said they didn't have a material impact on the election or voters' ability to cast their ballots. Jen Easterly, the director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said in a midnight press briefing that Tuesday's election did see some 'minor' disruptive activities, including polling station evacuations and delays. Easterly and other officials said the hoax bomb threats were sent to at least four states and were all deemed to be 'non-credible.' 'The point is this did not impact the ability of voters to cast their ballots or for their votes to be counted as cast,' Easterly said, commending the election officials on the ground in the states. 'Ultimately they were able to demonstrate extensive resilience based on their preparations for it. . Overall I would call this a good news story for democracy.' Eight states approved
2024110701077	constitutional amendments or ballot initiatives Tuesday to prohibit noncitizens from voting, a key Republican priority even though state and federal laws already prohibit it and despite studies showing it almost never happens. All the states adopted the measures by 2-1 margins or better. The constitutional amendments typically approved a very simple change of phrasing about citizens voting to add 'only' citizens may vote. North Carolina and Wisconsin were key swing states that each adopted constitutional amendments. Other states were Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Oklahoma and South Carolina. 'It is illegal for non-citizens to vote in our elections,' Michael Whatley, co-chairman of the Republican National Committee, said when filing lawsuits against states to prevent noncitizen voting. 'Yet time and again, we have seen Democrat officials oppose basic safeguards and dismantle election integrity provisions, intentionally opening the door to non-citizen voting in our elections.' Studies by the Brennan Center for Justice and the libertarian Cato Institute have found noncitizen voting is essentially nonexistent. A Georgia audit of voter rolls this year found 20 noncitizens among 8.2 million registered voters. Harris' candidacy demonstrated much of the advantages women have when they run for office, according to the Center for American Women and Politics. She was a formidable fundraiser. She connected with voters on issues important to her and to them. Her identify gave her a unique perspective on overlooked issues, the research center said in a statement Wednesday. But the race also exemplified research that shows obstacles female candidates face, primarily unequal expectations. That's particularly true for women of color, the center said. While women have held nearly every political office in America, they still hold fewer than a third of all political seats at every level of office - and still haven't reached the highest office in the land. 'Progress is not inevitable,' the center said. 'We have made great strides, yes, but there are many steps left on the path to parity.' Trump has run for president three times, winning the office in 2016 and now in 2024. So, can he run again in 2028? The 22nd Amendment of the U.S. Constitution prohibits one person from serving more than two terms as president. All presidents served no more than two terms until Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was elected president four times from 1932 to 1944. In 1947, two years after Roosevelt's death, a push began in the House of Representative to limit presidents to two terms. After some revisions by the Senate, the proposed amendment was approved and sent out to states, It was rtified on Feb. 27, 1951. Chad Murphy, Cincinnati Enquirer From pariah to president:From pariah to president: Donald Trump rises from the ashes to reclaim the White House An appearance on ABC's 'The View' last month provided a friendly forum for Harris to introduce herself to Americans unfamiliar with her story. But Harris struggled to explain what she would do differently than President Joe Biden. 'Not a thing that comes to mind,' the incumbent vice president told the hosts. Following Trump's victory over Harris, that television moment underscored a fatal flaw of Harris' campaign that doomed her election bid - an inability to separate herself from an unpopular president whose approval ratings have hovered around 40% for most of his four years in the White House. Read more details on why her pitch as a 'new generation of leadership' failed to win over the nation. Joey Garrison Has Harris

2024110623071	Advertisement Supported by After Kamala Harris became the second woman to lose a presidential election to Donald J. Trump, some women wondered if the glass ceiling would ever break. By Katie Rogers On the arduous climb toward the 'highest, hardest glass ceiling,' female presidential candidates persisted and resisted. They promised they were unbought and unbossed. Most of all, they believed the nation was ready for them. And, one by one, they were proven wrong. The United States has been led by men for all of its 248 years, and that will continue for at least four more. On Wednesday, Vice President Kamala Harris became the latest woman to fail to break the gender barrier to the presidency, and the second to be defeated by Donald J. Trump. Across the country, on text chains, during their commutes, in offices, with friends and family, women were processing the sting of another loss. Mothers consoled their daughters. Others tried to figure out how to explain what it meant, to their loved ones and to themselves, that Ms. Harris had been defeated by a man like Mr. Trump - who had bragged about stripping away the rights of women, about grabbing them by their genitals, and who had been held liable for sexual abuse. 'I'm terrified by him, to be honest,' said Nicole Saylor, an independent voter in Hendersonville, N.C., who has voted Democratic in the past few elections. 'And I'm terrified that I live in a country where 51 percent of the people voted for someone who is bigoted and misogynistic. I'm terrified that half of the country thinks it's OK.' Ms. Harris's loss brought many women a wave of sadness and pain, to be sure. But this time, there was another emotion at play. When Hillary Clinton lost to Mr. Trump in 2016, the anger and shock had been so palpable that it sparked a pink-hatted protest movement. Now, faced with the reality that Mr. Trump had been swept back into office with a broader electoral mandate than before, women across the country expressed grim resignation that their country was more welcoming to a second Trump term than to the idea of a woman leader. 'It's just nothingness in my head. I can't look ahead,' said Abby Clark, 42, who does environmental advocacy work in Detroit. 'I don't know how to plan. I can't picture the world we'll be in and what it will really be like. I just know that it will be difficult and hard.' Delivering her concession speech at Howard University, Ms. Harris did not speak about her loss in terms of gender or race. There was no talk of a glass ceiling. Instead, Ms. Harris spoke directly to the young voters who had gathered to see her. 'Don't ever stop trying to make the world a better place, you have power,' Ms. Harris said. 'You have power. And don't you ever listen when anyone tells you something is impossible because it has never been done before.' Throughout her 15-week campaign, Ms. Harris, a Black and South Asian woman, had tried to pivot away from questions about the historical significance of her candidacy to her desire to serve as a president for 'all Americans' - a strategy that freed her to challenge Mr. Trump on matters of policy and character. By the time Election Day arrived, she had taken her gender and her opponent's name out of her closing argument altogether, casting her fight as one about embracing a more united future. Ms. Harris and her party had bet it all on appealing to women by attacking Mr. Trump's character and reminding them that he was proud to have appointed three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade, ending the constitutional right to abortion. She
2024110623072	showed clips of Mr. Trump's bizarre behavior at her political rallies, and focused on his disparaging comments about women, minorities and political opponents in the final stretch. She invited women who had been harmed by restrictive abortion bans to take the stage at her events. And she and her advisers had been hopeful that Mr. Trump's own rallies would be a reminder of his track record with women. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat who for ran president in 2020, framed the loss as one that stung but one that still represented progress in the slow march toward a woman in the White House. 'It is enormously disappointing not to make it across the finish line in 2024,' said Ms. Warren, who had vied for the Democratic nomination in a field that included Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Ms. Harris. 'But we've come a long way in just a decade, and we're not giving up.' Presidential Election Results Map: See how Donald Trump won.

Republicans Clinch Control of the Senate: Tight races in swing states will determine their margin. For his part, Mr. Trump made an aggressive play for male voters, and at times he used misogynistic language to describe Ms. Harris, insulting her intelligence and claiming she lacked the stamina to lead the country. At a rally in North Carolina in the last days of the campaign, he chuckled at a remark shouted by a rallygoer that insinuated Ms. Harris had been a prostitute. 'This place is amazing,' he said. Ms. Harris did not respond to any of it. Some women who supported Mr. Trump argued that Ms. Harris's loss had little to do with gender. 'I think America is ready for the right female president,' said Fanchon Blythe, a Trump supporter and a Republican committeewoman who owns a nail salon in Lincoln, Neb. 'Kamala was not the right one.' She said that Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman who became a Republican and endorsed Mr. Trump, would make a good one. Christian Ramirez, 34, an executive assistant at Arizona State University who lives in Phoenix, said she had been a lifelong Democrat until the 2020 election, when she 'jumped ship' and voted for Mr. Trump. She voted for him again in 2024, saying that Democrats had lost her on a number of issues. 'They were trying to make it, 'Oh, Trump's against women. Kamala's pro-women,'' she said. 'But I don't think that's what it comes down to. It comes down to a lot more policies than just the abortion.' In the end, more than 105 years after the 19th Amendment was passed to bar states from denying women the right to vote, and 59 years after the Voting Rights Act was passed to ensure that all Black women and others could exercise that right, Americans again decided against sending a woman to the White House. Ms. Harris had been deliberate in trying to get Americans to see her in the role. She stood beside President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, checked up on people in states hit by hurricanes and delivered her campaign's closing argument in front of the White House. As they parsed the results of an election that had shown a drift toward Mr. Trump among nearly every voter demographic group, Democrats were soul-searching on Wednesday, questioning how much Ms. Harris's gender factored into her loss. 'I think it all mattered,' said Jane Kleeb, the chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party. 'Race, gender, city, rural, etc. We've run a battleground

The United States lags behind several other nations - Britain, Germany, Israel, India, Canada and, this year, Mexico - which have chosen women as leaders. Despite the long wait, America is far from alone. Men do still run the world, numerically. Only about a third of the countries in the United Nations have ever had a woman head of the government. Just 13 of the body's 193 member countries are currently led by women, according to the Pew Research Center. Eight years ago, Ms. Clinton, a former first lady, senator and secretary of state, won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College to Mr. Trump. In her concession speech, Ms. Clinton said she hoped that a woman would come along and shatter the glass ceiling 'sooner than we might think right now.' That wait continues. And this time, the road ahead seems more uncertain.

2024110710401	COVID took Donald Trump out of the White House-then, four years later, COVID put him back in. Shocks from the pandemic produced generational inflation on a global scale that wreaked havoc on incumbents in country after country. Cost-of-living increases made for an economy that most people feel hasn't worked for them. This was an election in which fundamental indicators pointed to the bums getting booted out. So they were. Looking at the breadth of Donald Trump's victory, then, it would be foolish to go too far down any particular rabbit hole of wrong tactical decision made here, inexact position on this issue there. The map wasn't what it was because Kamala Harris picked Tim Walz instead of Josh Shapiro as her running mate, because she was either too supportive of Israel's war on Gaza or not supportive enough, or because she spent too much time with Liz Cheney. The environment was the environment, and it's hard to pin the total blame on any one choice or person. That said, let's talk about President Joe Biden. The country decided years ago that Biden was too infirm to run for a second term. In June 2022, a New York Times poll showed that only 26 percent of Democrats thought he should be renominated, and their top concern was his age and visible decline. The idea that this person-whom the public also disapproved of for a variety of policy reasons-could serve as president until 2029 struck the country as absurd on its face. Biden and the Democrats took the wrong lesson, though, from the 2022 midterms. Somehow, Democrats' better-than-expected performance was interpreted in the White House as a vote of confidence in Biden, when he had little to do with it. The Democratic coalition had won over more high-propensity college-educated voters, who always turn out in midterms, while Republicans' coalition had become more irregular. The Supreme Court had, a few months earlier, taken away a constitutional right from an entire sex to have control over their bodies. Jan. 6 was still fresher in voters' minds, and Trump had worked diligently to ensure that Republicans nominated conspiratorial yahoos in every meaningful swing election. They didn't get very far without Trump on the ballot to inspire turnout. But the party incorrectly took the midterm performance as a sign that Biden should be locked in as the nominee. It would take more than a year and a half, and a shocking, late-in-the-game debate debacle, for Biden and the party to accept that his candidacy was untenable. Biden endorsed his vice president, and the party rapidly fell in line. This may still have been the right decision at that late point. The campaign apparatus could be swiftly transferred to another member of the ticket, and Harris already had-for better or worse-some experience being battle-tested in the spotlight of national politics. Your mileage may vary, but I find it difficult to be too upset with Harris. She was thrust into an impossible situation: facing extraordinary headwinds on the economy and the border and inheriting the administration's unpopularity without having been the decisionmaker. Having to define herself-and avoid being defined by Trump-in 90 days. Remaining loyal to Biden while trying to keep her distance. Having to take the weight of the future of the world on her shoulders. And having to persuade a country that has never elected a Black woman as president, or a woman at all, to elect her. You can't blame her for a lack of trying. And yet, her limitations as a politician were exposed, just as they were in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. She's too
2024110710402	cautious, too poll-driven, too mercenary. There's too much advice in her head, and no one really knows who she is or what she wants. These limitations are things that are useful to expose in a yearlong presidential primary. There was some thinking, after the Democrats' summer-candidate switcheroo, when Harris was riding high, that eschewing a messy primary altogether might be a model for the parties going forward, to the extent they could get away with it. Even if the Democrats' 2024 circumstances were replicable, which they aren't, I'd say that argument has been resoundingly rebuked. Harris may not have won a full-year primary against the best candidates the Democratic Party had to offer-or she might have, because she could've gotten sharper during that process. Democrats might have gotten sharper during that process. But that's a process Democrats didn't allow themselves to have because, despite a deafening chorus from the public that Biden shouldn't run for a second term, he did. Biden was certain to lose, and the most that replacing him with Harris atop the ticket did was give Democrats a chance. It was a Hail Mary. Despite what you may be seeing of late, those usually don't work. Democrats will spend the next years figuring out what went wrong and how to rebuild. We all eagerly await this tedious process. Want to know a little secret, though? They probably won't change much, and they may get away with it. Trump will make a mess of himself once he's back in office, and the (probably) unified Republican Congress will spend capital on slashing Medicaid and cutting taxes for rich people, setting Democrats up for improvement in the midterms. Democrats will have an open primary with star governors in 2028, and Republicans will nominate someone who won't have that special something Trump has in activating new voters. Since I started covering politics in 2007, I've seen the Republican Party declared dead (2008), the Republican Party declared dead (2016, after nominating Trump), the Democratic Party declared dead (2016, after Trump won), the Republican Party declared dead (2020), and now the Democratic Party declared dead (2024). Maybe this one will last. Probably not. But Democrats would do well to nominate someone who's capable of serving for eight years. And watch out for those pandemic-induced supply shocks.

2024110617051	Kamala Harris of the Democrat party has 67,951,593 votes (47.5%) Donald Trump of the Republican party has 72,659,067 votes (50.8%) Kamala Harris, 60, lost to Donald Trump in the 2024 US presidential election. Here's all you need to know about her. The Democratic candidate was beaten by Donald Trump who received more than 270 electoral college votes. Her Republican rival will be sworn in as president in January 2025. Harris was Joe Biden's running mate in 2020 when he defeated Trump in an acrimonious election campaign. She became the first black vice-president and the first woman in the role. Unique circumstances propelled Harris into the contest. Biden stepped aside in July and backed his deputy to take over, giving her an unexpected shot at the White House. There were no Democratic challengers so what is usually a campaign over 12 to 18 months, taking on party rivals in a gruelling fight for the nomination, was in her case compressed into less than four months. Her central promise in the campaign was to provide freedom of opportunity to working people through economic prosperity and expanded access to parental leave and childcare. Harris advocated for reproductive freedoms for women as some states limit access to abortion. She also backed the freedom to vote and freedom from gun violence - while being a gun-owner herself. Her critics questioned why as part of the Biden administration she did not already act on some of these promises, and she became the target of criticism on the issue of illegal immigration. In 2019, she took on nearly a dozen Democratic rivals to become the presidential nominee but dropped out before the first primary contest after a lacklustre campaign. Before she ran for the White House, some of her biggest moments featured her grilling witnesses in Congressional hearings. One famous example was when she asked Brett Kavanaugh, who was facing questions in order to become a Supreme Court justice, about abortion. He was unable to answer when she enquired whether he could think of any laws that gave the government the power to make decisions about men's bodies. Cancer researcher and civil rights activist Shyamala Gopalan Harris was the primary carer of the young Kamala after divorcing Jamaican-born Donald Harris. Shyamala immersed her daughter in her Indian heritage but also took her to a black cultural centre where the young Harris was inspired by trailblazing politician Shirley Chisholm and singer Nina Simone. Harris describes her mother as 'the most important person' in her life. After spending five years at school in Montreal where her mother was working, Harris enrolled in the black university, Howard, in Washington DC. She returned to the West Coast to begin her career as a prosecutor and soon rose through the ranks to become the top lawyer in California. She entered the US Senate in 2017. Entertainment lawyer Doug Emhoff was set up on a date with Harris by a mutual friend, a client of his. They married in 2014 and she became stepmother to his then teenage children, Cole and Ella, who call her 'Momala'. 'Our time as a family is Sunday dinner,' she told Elle magazine. 'Cole sets the table and picks the music, Ella makes beautiful desserts, Doug acts as my sous-chef, and I cook.' Harris has pushed for a law that would enshrine reproductive rights nationwide and vowed to fight any moves to reduce abortion access. She planned to address the cost of living by introducing a ban on price-gouging on groceries and help for first-time home buyers. She adopted a much stricter position on the southern border where illegal

The Democratic candidate also promised to back Ukraine as it tries to repel the Russian invasion. However, Donald Trump was able to persuade more voters with his agenda of high tariffs and low taxes and will move into the White House in the new year.

2024110710051	Advertisement Supported by Guest Essay By Damon Linker Mr. Linker, a former columnist at The Week, writes the newsletter Notes From the Middleground. The strategy of the Kamala Harris campaign sounded great on paper. She would stay clear of the unpopular progressive positions of 2019, unapologetically embrace American patriotism and freedom, and establish a broad coalition by gladly accepting the endorsements of former Republican officials and officeholders like Liz Cheney and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney. The approach seemed strategically reasonable. Modeled on the cross-ideological 'popular front' against fascism in the 1930s, it has been tried against right-wing populist parties and candidates in Israel, Hungary and other countries in recent years. Yet the strategy has, at best, a mixed record of success. Add in the sour, inflation-inflected mood among voters around the world that has brought down incumbents over the past year, and Ms. Harris's struggles can begin to look like the most recent episode of a continuing story. But the decisive defeat of the Harris campaign strategy has its own dimension - and it is not just the consequence of a fleeting bad vibe in the country or the world. For years and even decades, overwhelming majorities of Americans have been telling pollsters that they are unhappy about the direction of the country and much else besides. By portraying herself as the defender and champion of the country's governing establishment against Donald Trump's anti-system impulses and diatribes, she placed herself, fatally, on the wrong side of public opinion. For more than a decade, between 50 percent and 75 percent of the country has told pollsters they think the country is on the wrong track. That's the most widely discussed measure of discontent, but there are others that tell an even bleaker story. Asked by Gallup in October if they are satisfied with the way things are going in the country, barely more than a quarter of respondents said yes. Another longstanding Gallup poll tracks the level of public confidence in major U.S. institutions. It's been falling since the debacle of the Iraq War and the financial crisis of 2008, and currently reveals that a mere 28 percent of Americans have such confidence. Perhaps bleakest of all is a Pew poll about trust in government, which sits at an astonishingly low 22 percent. The reasons for this lost trust are almost too numerous to mention. Aside from the aforementioned Iraq War and financial crisis, there was a pandemic response by public health officials that many thought was far too draconian, with lockdowns causing widespread suffering and psychological and educational damage to children; a humiliating and demoralizing withdrawal of military forces from Afghanistan; the sharply rising prices of 2022 and spike in interest rates that followed, making many working people feel significantly poorer; skyrocketing public debt; surging rates of homelessness and the spread of tent encampments in American cities; a tense, frustrating and seemingly endless stalemate in Ukraine's war with Russia; and a flood of undocumented migrants streaming over the southern border, which continued largely unabated for years until the Biden administration was forced by political reality last summer to firmly address the problem. Maybe you don't consider all or even many of these to be failures. But many Americans do - and they consider them especially galling because those who have presided over them, from both parties, tend not to concede any fault. Officeholders develop policies and
2024110710052	implement them, and when voters disapprove of the outcome, those in charge more often than not simply move on to the next thing, hoping the discontent gets forgotten, or else wave away the criticism as a function of ignorance or disinformation. Turns out, that isn't very politically effective. On the contrary, it tends to lead the discontent to fester and develop into a virulent infection plaguing the body politic. Donald Trump is its foremost and most dangerous symptom. To put the problem in somewhat different terms: Ms. Harris ran for president as a conservative aiming to preserve, protect and defend the country's bipartisan political establishment against the anti-system furor that's been rising for many years in the electorate and that is fuel behind the MAGA movement. The problem is that there simply aren't enough voters in the mood to celebrate that establishment and its works. That poses a daunting problem for Democrats because, since the time of the New Deal nearly a century ago, the party has aimed to use the power of government to improve the lives of ordinary Americans. Since the 1990s, the impulse to find new ways to accomplish this goal has run up against potent, organized opposition, with the early ambitions of Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama met by resounding electoral repudiations in the midterm elections halfway through their first terms. But now skepticism, if not cynicism, about government goes beyond proposals to expand the size and scope of government. It extends to much of what the government already does, beyond automatic transfer payments and some forms of law enforcement. This doesn't mean Democrats need to pack it up and go home. Instead of proposing sweeping new programs or even taking a stand, as Ms. Harris did, in defense of the status quo, they could try to redefine themselves as responsible reformers. The first step in doing so would be to admit some of the mistakes public servants from both parties have made over the past two decades and express humility about them, along with the desire to learn from those errors. In some cases, this could yield promises to change or even halt some government work. Parts of what Ms. Harris proposed - reforms designed to increase the housing supply and lower housing costs; building on the Biden administration's efforts at permitting reform - were tentative steps in this direction. They paid few political dividends because they were isolated lines in stump speeches rather than integral parts (along with others) of the campaign's overarching vision of the country's future. Many Americans have lost their trust in government. Democrats need to be at the forefront of helping to earn back that trust. The first step toward doing so, like an effort to overcome an addiction, must be admitting there's a problem. If this week's painful drubbing at the polls has that effect on the party, it may well prove to have a salutary effect.

2024110622201	Watch CBS News By Melissa Quinn Updated on: November 6, 2024 / 5:20 PM EST / CBS News Washington - Vice President Kamala Harris conceded the election to President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday, urging her supporters in a speech delivered from her alma mater not to despair, but to continue 'the fight that fueled this campaign.' Harris addressed a crowd of supporters, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, from Howard University in Washington, D.C., after she was defeated by Trump in the race for the White House. 'Let me say my heart is full today. My heart is full today, full of gratitude for the trust you have placed in me, full of love for our country, and full of resolve,' Harris said. 'The outcome of this election was not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for, but hear me when I say the light of America's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting.' The vice president expressed gratitude to her family, President Biden, first lady Dr. Jill Biden, her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and her campaign staff. Mr. Biden watched the remarks from the West Wing, the White House said. 'I am so proud of the race we ran and the way we ran it. Over the 107 days of this campaign, we have been intentional about building community and building coalitions, bringing people together from every walk of life and background, united by love of country with enthusiasm and joy in our fight for America's future,' Harris said. And we did it with the knowledge that we all have so much more in common than what separates us.' Harris said the results of the election must be accepted and reiterated that she had spoken with Trump and is committed to a peaceful transfer of power. 'A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results,' she said. 'That principle as much as any other distinguishes democracy from monarchy and tyranny, and anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it.' Harris said the nation does not owe loyalty to a president or party, but to the Constitution, 'our conscience and to our God.' 'My allegiance to all three is why I am here today - to say while I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign,' she said. The vice president pledged to continue fighting for democracy, the rule of law and equal justice. 'Sometimes the fight takes a while. That doesn't mean we won't win,' she said, delivering an appeal directly to her young supporters. Harris continued, 'Do not despair. This is not a time to throw up our hands. This is a time to roll up our sleeves. This is a time to organize, to mobilize and to stay engaged for the sake of freedom and justice and the future that we all know we can build together.' The vice president's speech came just hours after she called Trump to congratulate him on his win and discussed the 'importance of a peaceful transfer of power and being a president for all Americans,' a senior aide to Harris said. The vice president, in her role as president of the Senate, will preside over Congress' counting of electoral votes during a joint session on Jan. 6 that will reaffirm Trump's victory. CBS News projected Wednesday that Harris had secured 222 electoral votes, short of the 291 amassed by Trump, her Republican opponent. Trump surpassed the 270 electoral votes needed to secure the presidency just after 5:30 a.m. ET Wednesday, after locking up the battleground states of Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. The vice president called
2024110622202	Trump to congratulate him on his win and discussed the 'importance of a peaceful transfer of power and being a president for all Americans,' a senior aide to Harris said. The vice president, in her role as president of the Senate, will preside over Congress' counting of electoral votes during a joint session on Jan. 6 that will reaffirm Trump's victory. Steven Cheung, spokesman for the Trump campaign, said that during the call, the president-elect 'acknowledged Vice President Harris on her strength, professionalism, and tenacity throughout the campaign, and both leaders agreed on the importance of unifying the country.' Mr. Biden also spoke with Harris by phone and congratulated her on a 'historic campaign,' the White House said. He also talked to Trump and 'expressed his commitment to ensuring a smooth transition and emphasized the importance of working to bring the country together.' Harris was expected to address supporters from Howard, the historically Black college where she graduated in 1986, on election night, but never made it to her alma mater as the results came rolling in. Instead, campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond sent the assembled crowd home and said Harris would speak on Wednesday. Election Day on Nov. 5 capped a chaotic and historic presidential election cycle that saw two assassination attempts against Trump and was roiled by Mr. Biden's sudden announcement in July that he would exit the race following a disastrous debate performance in late June. Harris swiftly announced her own candidacy for the White House, and Democrats quickly coalesced around her as their pick to take on Trump. Her nomination was solidified at the Democratic National Committee in Chicago in August, where Harris made history as the first woman of color to top a major party ticket.

2024110621561	Donald Trump has been declared the winner of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. After defeating Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump will serve a second term in the White House as the 47th President of the United States. While Trump gave his acceptance speech early Wednesday morning, we are still awaiting a concession speech from Harris. How can you watch the speeches, and why are they so important? Here's what you need to know. A counterpart to Trump's victory speech, Kamala Harris is expected to give a concession speech later today. While not a legal requirement, the concession speech has long been a tradition in American democracy, often signals a peaceful transition of power and offers clarity to supporters once the electoral votes are counted. The voluntary gesture is also considered a graceful tradition of American democracy. Just after winning three critical battleground states - North Carolina, Georgia and Pennsylvania - victor Donald Trump addressed the crowd gathered at the Palm Beach County Convention Center at 2:30 a.m. ET. He surpassed the 270 electoral votes needed for re-election at 5:34 a.m. ET Wednesday. During the 25-minute speech, Trump said the campaign 'overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible,' alluding to two assassination attempts while campaigning during the summer. - USA TODAY contributed to this report. This story has been updated with new information.
2024110622061	THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED The problem isn't that cities like Reading are now Trump strongholds, but that Harris's campaign gave few reasons for enthusiasm. One day before the presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris made her first campaign visit to Reading, Pennsylvania - a majority Latino city just an hour outside of Philadelphia. Donald Trump's campaign had been running outreach to Latino voters in the Berks County city since June, when the Republican National Committee opened a Latino Americans for Trump office as it ramped up its appeals to Latino voters across the state. When votes were counted in Berks County, the gap between the campaigns was stark. As in 2020, Berks again went for Trump on Tuesday - this time up 4.6 percentage points to 58 percent. Harris received 43 percent of the vote, where President Joe Biden had won 45.2 percent in 2020. The problem was not that Berks had become a Republican stronghold, but that Democrats had ceded the territory long before Trump opened his campaign office this summer. It was a familiar story to progressive organizers across Pennsylvania, who have spent the last several campaign cycles trying to claw back voters Democrats have left on the table. Democratic consultants in Pennsylvania had been caught on their heels in 2016, when Trump flipped the state red for the first time in three decades and won three counties that had voted twice for former President Barack Obama. When Biden won Pennsylvania back in 2020, analysts and organizers attributed the win to the work done in progressive cities like Philadelphia. But it wasn't the Biden campaign doing the legwork, it was progressives and independents working within coalitions led by groups like Pennsylvania Stands Up, Make the Road Action Pennsylvania, the Working Families Party, and unions like Unite Here and Service Employees International Union. Democrats' reliance on progressive enclaves and local organizers to fill the gap they lost with Trump's first win was never more clear than in the midnight hours heading into Wednesday, as Trump pulled away with electoral votes and Harris's narrowing path to victory fell once again to voters in cities like Philadelphia. While Biden won 13 Pennsylvania counties in 2020, Harris won just eight - with Trump flipping the counties of Bucks, Northampton, Erie, Monroe, and Centre. As the results solidified for Trump, mainstream media and Democratic pundits turned their fire not at the Harris campaign and the Democratic Party but in two other directions - at minority voters who had drifted, along with white men and women, toward Trump; and at progressives who had either stayed home or voted third party over Harris's role in the Biden administration's support for Israel's war on Gaza. Such criticism was misguided, said Working Families Party National Director Maurice Mitchell. Democrats, he said, had ceded turf to Republicans in states like Pennsylvania despite knowing they held the only key to winning the White House. 'That coalition is fraying at the margin for a number of reasons,' Mitchell said Tuesday night at WFP's watch party at the Sheraton Hotel in downtown Philadelphia. People are asking basic questions of both parties, Mitchell said. 'What concretely and materially are we gaining from this relationship? And they deserve answers.' That the race was so close is raising a vital conversation about Democrats' continued failure to build power outside of the four-year election cycle, said Philadelphia City Council minority whip Nicolas O'Rourke. 'Voting is the last thing that we do in
2024110622062	a functioning democracy.' O'Rourke is one of two Working Families Party members on the city council. Local Democrats fought tooth and nail against the WFP, but the group's wins ousted Republicans from the council in the heavily blue city for the first time in history with O'Rourke's 2023 win. He said the focus on whether Black men had strayed from the Harris campaign missed the larger reason for demographic shifts. 'The issue that I found, more often than not, was not an interest in Trump, it was a lack of interest in engagement. And that has been true beyond just this election season and cycle,' O'Rourke said. 'I continue to believe that there is an opportunity to engage Black men. They feel forgotten, not seen. They don't see the value in voting - some of them, not all. . There's a lot to be said about engagement from the political parties actually connecting with Black men before you're expecting them to turn out.' 'That is something that every party should be paying attention to, whether it's election season or not, because a functioning democracy would care about that.' A few hours before Harris made her first stop in Reading, Trump held a rally with thousands of people at the city's downtown Santander Arena. While Trump made fewer stops in Pennsylvania than Harris - 22 to Harris's 26 - Republican groundwork targeting voters in Latino, Black, and white working-class neighborhoods allowed him to outperform Democrats, who put much of their focus into persuading affluent voters in blue strongholds. While Latino men and women supported Biden by 59 and 69 percent, exit polls from Tuesday show that 55 percent of Latino men voted for Trump. Latino women still overwhelmingly supported Harris, but by 6 percentage points less than they had in 2020. Latino voters in Reading are reachable - Democrats just haven't put in the work, Reading's first Latino mayor, Eddie Moran, told Politico Magazine earlier this month. Moran won his 2019 primary against a Democratic incumbent by doing one thing: talking to Latino voters in neighborhoods Democrats had forgotten. Democratic outreach to Latinos happened largely with the help of groups like Make the Road Action PA, which focuses on engaging Black and brown voters. The group knocked on more than 560,000 doors, made contact with 50,000 voters in eight counties, and had 413,000 conversations with Latino voters across the state. 'In Pennsylvania, the minimum wage hasn't gone up in 20+ years.' Issues like the cost of living and housing were prominent across those conversations, said Diana Robinson, co-deputy director of Make the Road Action Pennsylvania. 'The rent is too high, people are struggling to pay their bills. That is something we think is unifying to folks across the board,' she said. 'In Pennsylvania, the minimum wage hasn't gone up in 20+plus years.' Kandice Cabeza, a Harris voter in Northeast Philadelphia, said she came out to support the right to abortion but was not thrilled about either candidate. She's originally from Baltimore but has lived in Philadelphia for 10 years. 'What are you doing for the people? What's changing with the cost of living, food, medical assistance, and things like that, medical bills? All those things matter too,' Cabeza said. 'I really haven't heard much about that from neither one of them. They're kind of feuding over who's gonna be number one. But what about us? It's kind of like, fingers crossed that someone looks out for all of us and not just a certain group.' Independent groups are doing the work of courting working-class voters that the Democratic Party has
2024110622063	stopped trying to reach, said WFP's Mitchell. 'It isn't necessarily drifting to the right in the way that some political pundits talk about it. Our approach is to take seriously meeting working-class people where they're at.' The working class is incredibly diverse, but a core set of issues unifies working people across ideology, Mitchell said. Three Working Families Party candidates flipped House seats in New York, where Democratic losses in the 2022 cycle cost the party the House. John Avlon and former Rep. Mondaire Jones, both Democratic candidates in New York who pivoted to the center, lost in swing districts. Rep. Pat Ryan, D-N.Y., faced an AIPAC-backed Republican challenger in the Catskills and the mid-Hudson Valley. Ryan campaigned alongside progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., in October. He won by 1 percentage point. 'Basically, it's class war, right? There's a reason why Democrats sometimes talk about taxing billionaires. Because it's hugely popular. We just think they need to say that a lot more,' Mitchell said. 'This group of working-class voters of all races that have either dropped out of politics in general and are hugely skeptical of politics, or are looking for other politics and are finding populist politics, and sometimes that brings them to the populist right.' In a statement on Wednesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-V.T., blamed Harris's loss on the party's neglect of working-class voters. 'It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working people would find that the working class has abandoned them. First, it was the white working class, and now it is Latino and Black workers as well,' Sanders said. 'Will the big money interests and well-paid consultants who control the Democratic Party learn any real lessons from this disastrous campaign? Will they understand the pain and political alienation that tens of millions of Americans are experiencing? Do they have any ideas as to how we can take on the increasingly powerful Oligarchy which has so much economic and political power? Probably not.' It's unsurprising to see bumps in minority support for Trump, Mitchell explained. 'When Black people are showing up for Democrats, it isn't unbridled support and unquestioning support for a political party. It's a strategic move,' he said. 'I want more Black voters asking questions and the political parties recognizing that there's a larger and larger component of the Black electorate that is persuadable.' The trends themselves aren't disturbing, Mitchell said. 'How you respond to those trends, I think, is critical. So if the Democratic Party doesn't take those trends seriously, then I think they would be in trouble. We're taking them seriously.' The End of Roe Jessica Washington This pattern held true in both red states and blue states, and even in states where efforts to protect abortion rights did not pass.

Some Democrats started writing her off when they pondered the party's future after Biden. But Harris found fresh purpose after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, and she became the White House's leading advocate for abortion rights. Harris also made a more concerted effort to network with local politicians, business leaders and cultural figures, forging connections that could serve her down the road. The moment arrived sooner than she anticipated, and she was catapulted into the presidential race with Biden's departure only a month before the Democratic National Convention. Harris instantly reset the terms of the contest with Trump. She was 18 years younger and a former courtroom prosecutor going up against the first major presidential candidate convicted of crimes. Her candidacy energized Democrats who feared they were destined for defeat with Biden at the top of the ticket. But she also faced steep odds from the beginning. She inherited Biden's political operation with just 107 days until the end of the election, and she faced a restless electorate that was eager for change. Although Harris pitched 'a new way forward,' she struggled to meaningfully differentiate herself from the unpopular sitting president. In addition, she had limited time to introduce herself to skeptical voters, who never cast a ballot for her in a presidential primary. Democrats now face the prospect of picking up the pieces during a second Trump presidency, and it's unclear what role Harris will play in her party's future. 'The work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump Presidency starts now,' wrote Jen O'Malley Dillon, Harris' campaign chair, in a letter to staff. 'I know the Vice President isn't finished in this fight, and I know the very people on this email are also going to be leaders in this collective mission.'

2024110622191	Vice President Kamala Harris offered an uplifting, positive charge to her supporters as she conceded the 2024 presidential election, acknowledging the stinging loss while committing to a peaceful transfer of power and vowing to 'fight' in a much different way than a defeated presidential candidate promised four years ago. 'Earlier today, I spoke with President-elect (Donald) Trump and congratulated him on his victory. I also told him that we will help him and his team with their transition and that we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power,' she said in remarks at Howard University, her alma mater, in Washington, DC. In making the remarks, Harris did something her opponent refused to do in the aftermath of the 2020 election: Accept its results. 'A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results. . At the same time, in our nation, we owe loyalty not to a president or a party, but to the Constitution of the United States, and loyalty to our conscience and to our God. My allegiance to all three is why I am here to say: While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign,' she said. One hundred and eight days after her campaign began, the self-described 'joyful warrior' spoke about her loss in determined terms as she sought to reassure the American people. 'I know folks are feeling and experiencing a range of emotions right now. I get it. But we must accept the results of this election,' she said. Closing a chapter in the history books after a tense campaign, the vice president offered a call to supporters to 'roll up our sleeves' in response to the election results. 'Do not despair. This is not a time to throw up our hands. This is a time to roll up our sleeves. This is a time to organize, to mobilize, and to stay engaged for the sake of freedom and justice and the future that we all know we can build together,' she said in her 12-minute remarks. She vowed to wage that fight 'in the voting booth, in the courts, and in the public square,' as well as in 'quieter ways: By treating one another with kindness and respect . by always using our strength to lift people up.' She also sent messages to her more youthful supporters. 'To the young people who are watching, it is okay to feel sad and disappointed, but please know it's going to be OK. On the campaign, I would often say, 'When we fight, we win.' But here's the thing, here's the thing, sometimes the fight takes a while. That doesn't mean we won't win. That doesn't mean we won't win,' she said. 'The important thing is don't ever give up. Don't ever give up. Don't ever stop trying to make the world a better place,' she continued. 'You have the capacity to do extraordinary good in the world.' With the glass ceiling still intact, Harris did not directly address the nation's failure to reach the historic, barrier-breaking outcome of a female president for the second time, something she largely avoiding highlighting on the campaign trail, rather letting surrogates do the talking for her. But she offered a nod to the moment: 'Don't you ever listen when anyone tells you something is impossible because it has never been done before.' The speech marked a conclusion to a historic and tumultuous election season that included President Joe Biden's decision to step aside following a catastrophic debate performance. His running mate quickly consolidated the party's support, ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket. Harris wore a dark suit late Wednesday afternoon and walked out to Beyonce's up-tempo anthem,
2024110622192	'Freedom,' as she has throughout her time on the campaign trail, pausing for several moments as the crowd applauded her. Her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, could be seen crying, as well as multiple attendees standing in the front row before her. Harris had gathered with close family and aides at the Naval Observatory on Tuesday evening and did not appear at her campaign's watch party at Howard University as thousands of her supporters gathered at her alma mater to watch the results come in. She officially conceded the race earlier Wednesday afternoon, offering her congratulations to Trump in a call that lasted only a few minutes, a person familiar said. Harris, a senior aide said, 'discussed the importance of a peaceful transfer of power and being a president for all Americans.' In a twist of irony, Harris' day job will soon require her to officially certify her own loss. The vice president, as president of the Senate, 'presides over the count and announces the results of the Electoral College vote' on January 6, 2025, according to the National Archives. 2024 Cable News Network.

2024110623151	Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Harris gave the speech at Howard University on Wednesday after the election was called for Donald Trump. By Mia Galuppo Film Writer On Wednesday at her alma mater, Howard University, Vice President Kamala Harris publicly conceded the 2024 presidential election to Donald Trump, calling for a peaceful transition of power but not relinquishing 'the fight for freedom.' In the audience at Howard were Nancy Pelosi and Harris' running mate, Tim Walz, among other politicians. Harris thanked her husband, Doug Emhoff, as well as President Joe Biden and her campaign staffers, while the crowd chanted her name. 'Now, I know folks are feeling and experiencing a range of emotions right now. I get it. But we must accept the results of this election,' said Harris, after an embattled campaign, adding that she talked to Trump earlier in the day. 'I told him we will help him and his team with their transitions, and we will engage with a peaceful transfer of power. 'While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign. The fight for freedom, for opportunity, for fairness and the dignity of all people. A fight for the ideals at the heart of our nation,' Harris continued. 'That is a fight I will never give up.' She added: 'Do not despair. This is not a time to throw up our hands. This is a time to roll up our sleeves. This is a time to organize, to mobilize and to stay engaged for the sake of freedom and justice and the future that we all know we can build together.' The election was awarded to Trump on Wednesday morning after Wisconsin was called in favor of the former president and current president-elect, earning him the 270 electoral votes necessary to regain control of the White House. It is unclear what is next for Harris, who will finish her term as vice president, a role she stepped into after serving as a U.S. senator. Before that, she served as the attorney general of California. Several news pundits called Wednesday's speech her legacy in the making and possibly her last as a public servant. Harris had many supporters in the entertainment industry and, on Wednesday, several took to social media to express their dismay at her loss. Filmmaker Adam McKay offered a scathing critique of the Democratic ticket, writing on social media, 'Who would have guessed lying about Biden's cognitive health for 2 yrs, refusing to do an open convention for a new nominee, never mentioning public healthcare & embracing fracking, the Cheneys & a yr long slaughter of children in Gaza wouldn't be a winning strategy? Anyone with half a brain?' Alternatively, Jeff Bezos offered Trump well wishes, writing, 'Big congratulations to our 45th and now 47th President on an extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory.' Toward the end of her speech, Harris addressed the country's young people saying, 'Please know it is going to be OK. Don't ever give up. Don't ever stop trying to make the world a better place. You have power, and don't you ever listen that something is impossible because it has never been done before.'

2024110620471	Kamala Harris has been defeated, Donald Trump is headed back to the White House, and the Democrats have begun soul-searching to determine what went so wrong in a landslide that saw the party lose ground with some of its most reliable constituencies. There's plenty of blame to go around. But most of the finger pointing hasn't been aimed at Harris, who ran a truncated campaign that was generally well-regarded before the Election Day drubbing. Instead, some of the sharpest criticism focused on President Joe Biden for moving forward with a catastrophic re-election bid that set the stage for an across-the-board failure. 'The story might have been different if he had made a timely decision to step aside and allowed the party to move on,' says David Axelrod, the strategist behind both of Barack Obama's presidential wins. The frustration with Biden, many Democrats argue, must be extended to those who enabled his bid for a second term, including members of his inner circle who shielded an 81-year-old President in physical decline. 'I don't believe that Joe Biden believed he was diminished,' says John Morgan, a Florida attorney and Biden donor. 'Now who may have known he was diminished were the sycophants around him in the White House.' But as the extent of Harris' loss becomes clearer, the focus on her missteps is likely to grow. Harris didn't just lose swing states. She ceded territory across the nation, including in blue states that Democrats have long taken for granted. In Rhode Island, the party's 27-point advantage under Obama shrunk to 21 points when Biden was the nominee, and shriveled to 9 points with Harris atop the ballot. Read More: How Trump Won. Across the first wave of exit polls were manifold signs of Harris failing to match Democrats' showing four years earlier. Biden carried 57% of women; Harris slipped to 54%. Biden carried 55% of voters who earned less than $50,000; Harris carried 48% of those working-class voters. Biden won the vote of 48% of those without a college degree; Harris claimed 44% of them. Biden won 71% of voters of color; Harris won 65%. Voters split 49%-49% on whether Biden or Trump could be trusted on the economy; Trump held a four-point advantage on the question. A Democratic strategist with deep ties to Biden's orbit says Democrats have long known they were weak with Latino and Black men, making the decision by Harris' team to put so much focus on turning out women with appeals to protect reproductive rights a major misstep. On the question of abortion rights, Latino voters who said abortion should be legal in most cases backed Biden-who struggled to even say abortion-by a 63%-34% margin. Four years later, Harris won by 9 nine percentage points on that question with Latinos. Among Black voters, Biden prevailed over Trump on the question of having abortion legal in most cases by a 94%-6% split. This year, Harris posted a 79%-18% advantage. It was clear, in hindsight, that an issue the party saw as a potent political weapon to turn out women may have also turned off men of color. Read More: What Trump's Win Means For His Legal Cases. While the initial criticisms of Harris were fairly mild, some party strategists saw in her cautious campaign a series of strategic blunders. 'She let the GOP define her,' says one senior Democratic operative. 'She could have left the convention and tried to reach out to voters from across the political spectrum, but she and [running mate Tim] Walz went inexplicably into hiding and didn't do interviews for weeks.' Plenty of other tactical choices drew second-guessing. Maybe
2024110620472	Harris should have been nicer to 'bros.' Maybe she wasted too much money on digital ads. Maybe she should have steered clear of lefty icons like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, or distanced herself from her boss more explicitly. Yet many had nothing but praise for Harris' polished run. 'I can't sit here and be like, 'She didn't come to Michigan enough.' She was here almost every day,' says Representative Haley Stevens, who was re-elected to represent her district in the northern Detroit suburbs. 'They didn't take anything in the Blue Wall for granted.' 'I think she ran the best campaign anyone in her position possibly could have. But that doesn't mean she was the right person,' says former Democratic congressman Tom Malinowski of New Jersey. 'In hindsight, I think there is a strong argument for having had an open competitive process in place' to replace Biden on the ticket, Malinowski says. Read More: World Leaders React to Trump's Win. The party's soul-searching is likely to extend to the groups it relies on to turn out the vote. Take, for instance, NextGen America, the party's biggest youth-vote machine, which spent almost $56 million, hired 256 staffers and recruited almost 30,000 volunteers. It was a massive undertaking-and yet Harris won just 55% of voters under the age of 30, lagging Biden's performance by five points. Another group, Swing Left, raised $25 million from Red State Democrats for on-the-brink districts, knocked on almost 350,000 battleground doors in the final weekend, and placed more than a half-million calls in that final push. The celebrity-tinged GOTV machine didn't work. Yet to some observers, focusing on campaign minutia misses the bigger picture-that Harris may have been doomed from the start by forces outside of her control. 'No incumbent party has ever won with a president with a 40% approval rating or under,' says Axelrod. 'No party has won with people's attitudes about the economy what they were.' Harris, Axelrod argues, had the added challenge of running while the country is still suffering from post-pandemic PTSD, which helped Republicans tap into anti-establishment rage. 'These forces were so large that I'm not sure where there are strategic or tactical decisions that could have changed the outcome,' says Axelrod. 'At the end of the day, being the VP of an Administration that people wanted to fire may have been an insurmountable obstacle.' Another Democratic strategist with deep ties to organized labor suggests the stars were aligned for Democrats to fail, even against a candidate as flawed as Trump: 'Maybe this was actually just inevitable as a result of years of economic concerns and inflation-like [what] happened to pretty much every incumbent in the entire world.' Yet even considering world trends and economic cycles, some saw in the verdict an unmistakable sign of misogyny. To this camp, it's hard to ignore that Trump has now won twice against female opponents, while losing to an old white man. Rodell Mollineau, a former senior aide to Democratic Senate Leader Harry Reid, notes that despite his overwhelming victory, Trump was an unpopular candidate himself. 'They picked him over a Black woman,' Mollineau says. 'This is a tough pill to swallow.' It's a point not lost on Biden's shrinking circle of defenders. ''Everyone who destroyed Biden and pushed him out, got the race they demanded,' says a Democratic state committee member in Pennsylvania. 'There was a choice: The only person that ever beat Trump, or a gigantic unknown.' Write to Philip Elliott at philip.elliott@time.com and Charlotte

2024110622471	Vice President Kamala Harris launched her presidential campaign from a standing start three months ago. And Wednesday afternoon it came to an end, unable to overcome Donald Trump's sweeping wins in former Democratic strongholds. Harris walked out for her final speech of the campaign on the Yard at her alma mater Howard University, in front of a crowd dotted with reddened eyes and cheeks wet with tears. As she had so many times on the campaign trail, Harris entered to the sound of Beyonce's 'Freedom.' This time, the song's lines 'a winner don't quit on themselves' hit differently. As Harris spoke, the crowd's energy was dulled by the stinging loss. 'My heart is full today,' Harris told her supporters, many of whom had been in the same spot in front of Frederick Douglass Memorial Hall the night before hoping for a different outcome. Someone in the crowd shouted, 'We love you!' and Harris replied, 'I love you back!' She went on to say that she is 'full of love for our country and full of resolve.' She said she is 'so proud' of the race she ran 'and the way we ran it.' She had wanted it to be a victory speech, not a concession, but she said she was willing to accept the outcome, and she expected everyone else to as well. Harris drew a contrast to how Trump handled his defeat to Joe Biden in 2020. Trump refused to accept his loss and fomented a violent riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 to try to overturn it. 'I know folks are feeling and experiencing a range of emotion right now-I get it,' Harris said with a small smile, alluding to some of the personal toll the campaign's roller coaster has taken. When she mentioned Trump had won the election, boos moved through the crowd. 'We must accept the results,' Harris said. Harris made a point of saying that she and President Joe Biden will engage in a 'peaceful transfer of power,' which she described as an act that 'distinguishes democracy from monarchy or tyranny.' In a pointed critique of Trump's public demands for loyalty from those who work for him, Harris said that Americans 'owe loyalty not to a President or a party, but to the Constitution of the United States.' Harris insisted that while the campaign was over, her work wasn't done. 'While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign,' she said. She pledged to keep working to ensure women 'have the freedom to make decisions about their own body' and fight for rule of law and equal justice. She implored Americans to treat 'one another with kindness and respect' and 'use our strength to lift people up.' She wanted kids watching to know that 'it is going to be ok.' She said that her chant on the campaign trail, 'when we fight, we win,' is still true. But, she added, 'sometimes the fight takes a while--that doesn't mean we won't win.' The crowd listened intently but lacked the sparkling energy that had marked many of her rallies during her three-month sprint for the White House. She filled arenas with people chanting 'We're not going back,' and crowds eager to hear her describe how, as an attorney general in California, she'd prosecuted predators, fraudsters and cheaters, as she wound up to her punchline: 'I know Donald Trump's type.' Her central pitch to voters, that she'd 'turn the page' on Trump and work to protect access to abortion and lower costs for middle-class families, didn't break through. Her message was swamped by Trump's inflammatory descriptions of immigrants and murderers and rapists, his attacks on critics as the 'enemy within,' and his insistence that only he could fix the country's high
2024110622472	prices and immigration challenges. In parting, Harris said she wanted to leave the crowd with a reminder of an adage that says 'Only when it is dark enough can you see the stars.' Harris said she knows people feel the country is 'entering a dark time' and she hopes that is not the case. 'If it is, let us fill the sky with the light of a brilliant, brilliant billion of stars.'

2024110622411	Menu Giving a concession speech before a crowd of supporters, Vice President Kamala Harris acknowledged the disappointment of losing a presidential election but encouraged supporters to keep hope for their future alive. 'The outcome of this election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for,' Harris told supporters at her alma mater Howard University on Wednesday. 'But hear me when I say the light of America's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting. Harris said she reached out to Trump to congratulate him on his electoral win, while also informing him that 'we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power.' RELATED STORY | Donald Trump projected to win presidential election, beating VP Kamala Harris The message is in stark contrast to how the 2020 presidential election ended. Trump refused to acknowledge his defeat and did not greet Joe Biden before leaving the White House. 'A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results,' Harris said. 'That principle as much as any distinguishes democracy from monarchy or tyranny. And anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it.' Harris' presidential campaign came to an end just months after it started. She jumped to the top of the Democratic ticket after President Biden dropped out of the race in July. She had a few short months to reintroduce herself to the public, select a running mate and craft policies she planned to implement if she were to be elected president. RELATED STORY | GOP flips at least 2 seats held by Democrats, will hold Senate majority in 2025 Her campaign appeared to gain momentum from the start, becoming a fundraising juggernaut. It reported raising $1 billion in a few short months. However, money alone wasn't enough to propel Harris to victory. Trump's message about improving the economy and cracking down on illegal immigration appeared to resonate with voters. By early Wednesday morning, it was clear Trump would become the 47th president of the United States. Supporters of the vice president told Scripps News on Wednesday that Harris did everything she could, but didn't have enough time to make her case. Others felt race and misogyny played a role in the vice president's defeat. Harris, meanwhile, did not point any fingers. Instead, she encouraged her supporters to continue fighting for issues that impact their lives. 'America, we will never give up the fight for our democracy, for the rule of law, for equal justice and for the sacred idea that every one of us, no matter who we are or where we start out, has certain fundamental rights and freedoms that must be respected and upheld,' Harris said.

2024110620291	Last night Americans decisively elected Donald Trump as the 47th president of the United States. Unlike in 2016, Democrats don't look like they will have the popular vote/Electoral College split to fall back on as a rationalization. Trump swept all seven battleground states and Republicans took the Senate, leaving Democrats clinging to tenuous hopes of an improbable victory in the House as consolation. Party strategists and elites will spend months, if not years, dissecting this disaster, how it transpired and where to go from here, but in terms of why Kamala Harris lost this election, it really isn't terribly complicated. Voters were miserable and it should not be surprising, despite Trump's unfailingly repugnant antics, that they took that misery out on the sitting vice president of the United States. For two years voters have been telling pollsters that they are angry about the economy and immigration policy. Harris not only failed to offer those voters a compelling vision of change, but she also generally refused to capably defend her administration's own policies. Instead, especially in the campaign's closing days, she doubled down on the democracy rhetoric which, while I happen to think it is perfectly justified, was not resonating with undecided voters. Those undecideds seem once again to have broken for Trump according to exit polls, contrary to the hopeful Democratic narrative that took shape over the final week of the campaign. Whatever you think of his policy agenda, if nothing else it offers a clean break with the Biden-Harris record. And voters picked the clean break. That doesn't necessarily mean that the outcome has been baked in all along. Swapping Harris in for President Joe Biden likely kept down-ballot races from getting out of hand and may preserve Democrats' ability to flip the Senate back in 2026 with a strong performance. But Harris, while she ran a disciplined campaign that made few day-to-day mistakes, was clearly operating with several flawed theories of the electorate. Were these errors the difference makers? We'll truly never know, but it is certainly worth exploring where the candidate and the party went wrong, starting with their appeal to Never Trump Republicans. The first flawed assumption was that there were further inroads to be made with Republicans who are uncomfortable with Trump. As I argued here recently, most of those people have already switched parties and have been Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents for years. Nothing that Trump did over the past six months, as crazy as this seems, is much different from things he did beginning in 2015. If you were going to get off the Trump train, you did so six stops back. Harris was waiting patiently at the station for passengers who had already disembarked. That means that her closing flurry of campaign stops with former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney and indeed the whole 'Republicans for Harris' effort along with the deeply conservative messaging and rhetoric that the campaign adopted beginning at the Democratic National Convention in August, was likely all for nothing. Worse, it may have actively alienated young people and lower-propensity voters who were looking for change. These are groups of voters who are disproportionately dissatisfied with the status quo, and nothing says 'I am the status quo' more than cavorting with a widely disliked Republican congresswoman who is the icon of a long-vanished Republican political coalition that steered the country into several gigantic icebergs in the early 2000s and which no longer has any meaningful
2024110620292	political constituency in America. The second assumption is that Harris could not afford to break decisively with President Biden on anything of substance. Rather than making a meaningful pivot on Israel and Palestine, Harris inexplicably dispatched Rep. Ritchie Torres and former President Bill Clinton to Michigan to appeal to Arabs and Muslims who, unsurprisingly, ended up rejecting her anyway. And instead of acknowledging that the Biden-Harris campaign may have erred in some early administration immigration decisions, she went on The View and said that she couldn't think of anything that she would have done differently. This worked out about as well for her as refusing to disavow George W. Bush's Iraq War did for Republican nominee John McCain in 2008. I will never understand why the campaign calculated that it couldn't do this. Who were they afraid of? Joe Biden? What was he going to do, call her into the Oval Office and slur his way through some sort of admonishment? And if she wasn't going to break with Biden, the least she could have done was try to convince people that the economy is actually good. I know voters tuning in at the last minute aren't known for their understanding of nuance, but if the story is that the administration believes real wages outpaced inflation, and that the U.S. recovery from the pandemic is the best in the world, why not say that over and over? Why not brag about the stock market? Why not open every rally by asking people to take out their phones and load their 401k charts? It certainly worked for Trump. Pinning this entirely on Harris, however, is a mistake. Voters seemed tired of being governed by Democrats and, fairly or unfairly, blamed the party for their sense that the country is on the wrong track. It is not clear to me that any candidate could have successfully navigated through those headwinds, even with a perfect campaign. Democrats will certainly have plenty of time in the wilderness over the next two years to think about how to avoid putting themselves in this position again.

2024110617381	Vice President Kamala Harris implored supporters to 'not despair' and continue fighting for a better America in a short concession speech Wednesday after losing the election to Republican former president Donald Trump. 'This is not a time to throw up our hands, this is a time to roll up our sleeves,' Harris told a crowd of supporters at Howard University, her alma mater and a historically Black university that was also the site of her deflated election night watch party the previous evening. Harris thanked her team for a hard fought campaign that spanned just over three months and centered around an efforts to build community that focused on a shared love of the country. 'My heart is full today,' Harris began. 'Full of gratitude for the trust you have placed in me, full of love for our country and full of resolve.' Harris did not appear at her event Tuesday night as returns worsened for her campaign and the mood among her supports quickly turned from hopeful to distressed. The Associated Press called Wisconsin for Trump at 5:34 a.m. Eastern Time, pushing him past the necessary 270 electoral votes to claim the White House. In her speech, Harris noted the importance of a peaceful transfer of power as a distinguishing feature of democracy, compared to tyranny. 'In our nation we owe loyalty not to a president or a party but to the Constitution of the United States,' Harris said. She did not make a direct mention of the last presidential transfer which was interrupted by rioters who stormed the Capitol, spurred on by Trump, while Congress attempted to certify Biden's win over Trump. It was a decisive defeat for the Harris campaign, which by Wednesday morning had lost the key battleground states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia and North Carolina. Harris was trailing in the popular vote as well as in three other swing states: Nevada, Arizona and Michigan, while ballots in those and other states continue to be counted. Trump's battleground state victories, particularly in the 'blue wall' states of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, shattered any hope the Harris campaign had late Tuesday night of holding out for victory. On Wednesday, Harris called Trump to concede and congratulate him on his victory, the president-elect's campaign reported. 'President Trump acknowledged Vice President Harris on her strength, professionalism, and tenacity throughout the campaign, and both leaders agreed on the importance of unifying the country,' said Steven Cheung, Trump's campaign communications director. Going into Election Day, polling showed support for Harris and Trump was evenly split. Voters remained sharply divided going into the consequential elections with Democrats making the case that the former president was unfit for office and a threat to democracy. Republicans largely cited immigration and the economy in their support for Trump. But results showed Harris severely underperforming in almost every state compared to Joe Biden's 2020 campaign. Election forecasters say typically, late-arriving mail ballots favor Democratic candidates, but the gap became insurmountable for Harris in several battleground states. Nationally, there were fewer mail-ballots compared to the 2020 election - which happened in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic - and ballots were counted faster in many states this time. The map for Trump's stunning political comeback looked nearly identical to his first presidential victory in 2016. Trump called his victory 'an unprecedented and powerful mandate' and said he's 'going to help our country heal' in remarks to supporters in West
2024110617382	Palm Beach early Wednesday. The 78-year-old Republican will become the first president in more than 130 years to win non-consecutive terms. Trump will also be the first convicted felon to win the White House, though his victory will likely give him new legal protections in four separate criminal cases against him. Harris' remarkably short presidential campaign began after Democrats forced Biden from the ticket following a disastrous June debate performance against Trump. Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris in July. A native Californian who served as San Francisco's district attorney and the attorney general, voters elected Harris to represent the state as a senator beginning in 2017. Shortly after, Harris ran for President in the 2020 race but she dropped out before primary voting began. Following Biden's decision to drop out of the race in July, Trump pivoted to attacking Harris, criticizing her record on immigration and tying her to inflation that took place under Biden's administration. On Wednesday, Biden separately spoke with both Harris and Trump. The president congratulated Harris on her historic campaign and Trump on his victory. He invited Trump to meet in the White House and expressed the importance of uniting the country. Biden plans to address the nation on Thursday and discuss the transition.

2024110705071	Vice President Kamala Harris appears to have improved Democrats' chances among only one voting bloc when compared to four years ago: white college-educated voters. There has been plenty of finger-pointing over what led to President-elect Donald Trump's decisive victory in the presidential election that many believed ahead of Tuesday could be one of the closest America has ever seen. One factor raised by several critics is that Democrats have lost touch with working-class Americans, which may be reflected in Tuesday's exit polling. Trump beat Harris in nearly every major battleground state and improved among several key demographics, namely Latino voters. According to CNN's exit polls from 2020 and 2024, Trump gained 14 points among Latinos, with Harris winning the bloc by just 6 points this week. In 2020, President Joe Biden won the Latino vote by 33 points. One demographic that Harris did improve on compared to Biden's exit polling was white voters who hold college degrees. According to CNN's exit poll for the 2024 election, the Democratic nominee won the bloc 52 percent to 45 percent on Tuesday. In 2020, Biden won the same group 51 percent to 48 percent. Harris, however, lost ground with voters of color who hold college degrees. While Biden won that demographic by 43 points in 2020 (70 percent to 27 percent), Harris won the same voters by 10 points less, leading Trump 65 percent to 32 percent, per CNN's exit poll. Democrats also lost ground among voters of color who hold no degree. In 2020, Biden won the bloc 72 percent to 26 percent. On Tuesday, Harris won the same voters 64 percent to 34 percent. By income levels, Trump also seems to have won over working-class families. In 2020, Biden won over voters making under $50,000 annually by 11 points. On Tuesday, that group swung toward Trump by 3 points (50 percent to 47 percent), per CNN's exit polling. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who was reelected this week, released a scathing rebuke of the Democratic Party on Wednesday accusing them of ignoring working-class Americans. 'It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them,' Sanders said in a statement. 'While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change,' he added. 'And they're right.' Newsweek has reached out to Harris' campaign for comment. The vice president's team has also faced backlash from within its own party over the issue of elitism. The Philadelphia Democratic Chair, Bob Brady, told WCAU on Wednesday that he was frustrated at the lack of communication between the Harris campaign and the local party. 'Talk to us a little bit. Give us a little bit more resources. Show us some respect. Didn't happen,' Brady said. 'They were just elitist and went out there, did their own thing and didn't include Democratic city committee or (ward leaders) or committee people. They just didn't do it.' A spokesperson for Harris' team responded to Brady's criticism, telling WCAU, 'The Pennsylvania for Harris team knocked on more than two million doors in the weekend leading up to Election Day, which is two million more doors than Bob Brady's organization can claim to have knocked during his entire tenure as party chairman.' 'If there's any immediate takeaway from Philadelphia's turnout this cycle, it is that Chairman Brady's decades-long practice of fleecing campaigns for money to make up for his own lack of fundraising ability or leadership is a worthless endeavor that no

2024110620411	(This story was updated to add new information.) On the heels of President-elect Donald Trump's successful re-election bid, including in Wisconsin, Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a concession speech Wednesday afternoon. Harris addressed the nation from Howard University, her alma mater in Washington, D.C. She was also scheduled to speak from Howard Tuesday night at her would-be victory party, but her remarks were cancelled as the election began to swing in Trump's favor.
2024110617251	Advertisement Vice President Kamala Harris is slated to speak at 4 p.m. Eastern time from Howard University, according to a campaign official briefed on her plans. By Remy Tumin and Katie Rogers Vice President Kamala Harris will address the nation on Wednesday afternoon in what is expected to be her concession speech, officially bringing to a close a furious race to stop former President Donald J. Trump from returning to the White House. Ms. Harris is slated to speak at 4 p.m. Eastern time from Howard University, in Washington, according to a campaign official briefed on her plans. The university, Ms. Harris's alma mater, is the same place that was meant to host a victory party on Tuesday evening had she won the election. But as results came in and Mr. Trump's lead strengthened, she never made an appearance. Ms. Harris will call Mr. Trump soon to concede the election, according to a senior official familiar with her plans who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly. The Harris campaign sent a message to supporters in Washington on Wednesday inviting them to attend the event and signing off with 'deep appreciation.' Ms. Harris graduated from Howard in 1986 and has referred to her time at the historically Black university as 'a place that shaped her.' Mr. Trump declared victory in the early hours of Wednesday before securing the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win. In his victory speech in West Palm Beach, Fla., Mr. Trump declared that he was the leader of 'the greatest political movement of all time.' 'We overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible,' he said, adding that he would take office with an 'unprecedented and powerful mandate.'

2024110622081	Things you buy through our links may earn Vox Media a commission. For a few brief weeks in the summer, it appeared like the Democratic Party was listening to voters. In July, President Joe Biden announced he would no longer seek reelection, and Vice-President Kamala Harris stepped in; soon, she announced that Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota would be her running mate. Walz had a reputation for pushing through a relatively progressive agenda in a purple state with a large rural population, and Harris herself adopted a message of freedom. She didn't shy away from discussing abortion on the campaign trail, and in August, she released a number of economic policies that were partly aimed at addressing voters' top concern, inflation, with proposals like a ban on grocery-store price gouging. Even so, Harris was never my great hope as a leftist. Though I believed at the time that she was the most obvious candidate to replace Biden on the ticket, I knew she wouldn't run like Senator Bernie Sanders. Perhaps she wouldn't have won no matter what she did or said - a reflection of Biden's toxicity. At the same time, the magnitude of her loss has brought her strategy into focus, and as Wednesday dawned, it was evident that she and her aides had misread the electorate. She squandered her early momentum by not distancing herself from an unpopular president while courting a moderate vote that never materialized. In doing so, she failed to mobilize voters, including many white women. The fault ultimately lies with Harris, Biden, and the party. Early on, Harris claimed her candidacy marked a generational shift away from Biden and Trump, but it was never entirely clear what she meant by that. Perhaps she thought the facts spoke for themselves. She could speak coherently and she wasn't in her 80s. Although she never ran on her gender or race, her identity as a woman of color also sharpened the contrast between herself and the president. But it's always a mistake to conflate a politician's identity with transformational change, and as Harris ran, she never truly broke with Biden. Not on Gaza, or on much of anything else. During an appearance on The View, she said that she couldn't think of much that she would have done differently than Biden had - other than putting a Republican in her cabinet. Like the president, she stressed her willingness to work across the aisle. She embraced Liz Cheney, a right-wing chicken hawk, and brandished endorsements from Never Trump Republicans. As the race wore on, it became clear that Harris was no populist at all. Instead, she was beholden to the very establishment that had elevated her. The Never Trumpers who backed her might be fixtures on cable news, but they were never going to deliver enough voters to Harris. Their audience consists of liberals who want to believe that our norms still work and the center still holds. It doesn't. It hasn't for years. To some extent that falls on Biden, who pledged a return to normal politics and failed to deliver, but Harris also did not recognize the danger he'd put her in. She tacked consistently to the center right, hoping that a handful of technocratic economic policies and a pro-Roe message would be sufficient. Meanwhile, a majority of voters knew that our norms had failed, and felt keenly that the economy didn't work for them. That includes many women, who don't vote solely on abortion. They are often in charge of the household pocketbook, and although inflation is going down and inequality has narrowed, they're still affected by the high cost of living. Rents are up and mortgages
2024110622082	are expensive, as are child care and health care. Despite this, the New York Times reported that Harris spent more time with billionaire Mark Cuban in October than she did with Shawn Fain, the president of the United Auto Workers. Donald Trump had bet on a sense of aggrieved masculinity as the return path to power, and while there's much we don't know about who turned out to vote and why, his strategy did not alienate white women in the numbers Harris needed to win. Misogyny and racism should receive due attention in postmortems to come, but they can't explain Tuesday on their own. The story is more complicated, and dire. Though she spoke of freedom, of forward motion, of change, voters did not trust her to deliver. Some will blame the left for this, but Harris tried centrism as did Biden and Clinton before her, and that didn't work, either. Leftists do not control the Democratic Party and never have; only consider the party's intransigence on Gaza. If the Democratic brand is poison now, blame its grifter consultants, who never fail out of politics no matter how many pivotal races they lose. Blame Harris, too, whose message was simply too anemic to overcome decades of Democratic failure. Trump will now return to power, perhaps with a Republican Congress. Women will inevitably suffer, even those who voted for him. When they begin to hurt, they will need help, and someone will have to offer it to them. Maybe that person will be a Democrat. Maybe they'll be an independent. Maybe we know their name already and maybe we don't. Whoever they are, they have to do what Harris didn't, and break with recent history in order to try something new. 'Sometimes, the fight takes a while. That doesn't mean we won't win,' Harris said during her concession speech on Wednesday, and that could be true but only if her party restructures itself. I'm not entirely sure what that ought to look like, but I do believe it's possible to glean some insight from the wreckage of Tuesday evening. Some will say that Trump's opponents must sacrifice the rights of transgender people and immigrants and women to win, which fundamentally misunderstands the problem. Voters believe, wrongly, that Trump works for them. Democrats - or whoever else - must convince them otherwise, preferably with a populist economic message that addresses their concerns without throwing our most vulnerable workers to the wolves. It's possible. More than that, it's necessary. Women deserved more from Harris and her party, and so did everyone else.

2024110700001	By Daniel D'Addario Chief TV Critic The tricky things about defining moments is that they're only clear in retrospect. Partisans of Vice President Kamala Harris in this year's election might, before the outcome became suddenly and crushingly clear on Tuesday night, have thought the campaign was defined by her romp over former President Trump in their one debate together, or by her team's relatively agile response to the late-in-the-race 'floating island of garbage' gaffe, or by the vague 'joyful' energy of the album 'Brat.' But perhaps the key moment - both in and of itself and for what it revealed about where the candidate was willing to go, and where she was not - happened in an October appearance on 'The View.' Co-host Sunny Hostin asked Harris whether she would have done anything differently from President Joe Biden over the past four years; Harris responded 'There is not a thing that comes to mind,' before saying that she had been a part of most major decisions the administration had made. It speaks, first, to Harris' near-impossible position: Running both as an incumbent and a challenger, a member of an administration of which the public had grown weary who had to convey a sense both of continuity and of change simultaneously. (An accidental candidate and, though energetic and thoughtful, ultimately the wrong one for her moment, Harris would not have been in this position had her unpopular boss made the decision not to run for re-election much earlier.) And it gives, too, a sense of a certain congenital unwillingness to take a risk: To have broken with Biden in any meaningful way would have been to endure some short-term discomfort at her current job (she was, and is, still the Vice to his President) in order to make clear why she deserved a prospective next job. No small measure of personal vanity seems at play as well: Harris' insistence on emphasizing that she has been a part of the administration's decision-making seems, looking back, an odd thing to say in a climate where the decisions the administration made - some of whose economic benefits will be felt, the administration has argued, deep in the future but are not yet felt today - left much of the country feeling as if things were on the wrong track. (Exit polls indicated that some three-quarters of the country were dissatisfied with the direction of the nation, a tough situation for the incumbent party's candidate no matter who she might be.) This seems not to have been a winnable election for Harris: It's not worth pretending that had she made a different comment on 'The View,' she would have reversed the nation's striking rightward shift. But the show ought to have been an easy assignment: It's a panel discussion with a group of women who were all, to a one, vocal Trump critics, and who were all, furthermore, unapologetic in their support of a female candidate for president. And Harris had diverged from Biden in, for instance, the fulsomeness of her support of a woman's right to choose. What her refusal to break with Biden did was not to change a dynamic that already existed but, perhaps, to reveal it: Harris was, in the end, burdened by what had been. 0 Comments Comments are moderated.

2024110618281	His resounding victory will be blamed on 'populism', but that's lazy thinking. He addressed the key concerns far better than the Democrats did Since we'll hear a lot, again, about 'populism', let's remember, again, that 19th-century US populism had a healthy strain of leftwing politics. Defending workers, riling up bankers, decrying the 'cross of gold' and economic conservatism: look past his Bible-bashing, and William Jennings Bryan was a precursor to Franklin Roosevelt. Yet for much of this election year, the populists' modern-day successors in the Democrats have served up an anti-populism: telling voters they were wrong. Americans were told they were wrong to see the corrosion of Joe Biden's abilities, and wrong to think that his replacement should not be decided in a giant backroom stitch-up. They were wrong not to enjoy the US economic miracle, and wrong not to worry about the future of democracy. Black and brown people and students were wrong to expect the party to oppose the bloodbath in Gaza. Latinos were ungrateful to desert the party of racial equality, while Black men were boneheaded not to back a Black woman. Everyone was wrong not to lap up the rallies opened by Beyonce and Usher, the skits on Saturday Night Live and that clip of Barack Obama rapping. Why couldn't they just feel the joy? For reasons I'll explain in a moment, I'm no fan of explanations that begin and end with the bogeyman of 'populism'. They almost always wind up with well-lunched commentators ventriloquising the opinions of people they've never talked to and in whose worlds they've never set foot. Look at the exit polls and you see a materialist explanation for what's just happened: two out of three US voters report their economy is bad. And they have an excellent point. As I wrote last month, look at the data over the long run and two big trends stand out. First, for the vast majority of US employees - whether middle class or working class, teacher or shop assistant - wages have flatlined. Not for four or even 20 years - but for most of the past half century. Strip out inflation, and average hourly earnings for seven out of 10 employees have barely risen since Richard Nixon was in the White House. I can't think of a more flammable political economy than a country with a few very rich people where most workers only get by because of low gas and food prices. Then what happens? A second blow. Covid peters out, the world comes out of lockdown and low-wage America is doused in that most combustible of economic substances: inflation. The entire system goes up - and Donald Trump spots his chance. Faced with the flames, what would be a left-populist response? It wouldn't be to resort to pedantry, to correct angry voters by showing them the aggregate figures - but that's what many Democrat supporters did. Nor would it be to roll back all the benefits extended over the pandemic: the improved child tax credit, Medicaid and unemployment insurance. But that's what Joe Biden did, even as he shovelled billions into infrastructure. The electoral result was that working- and middle-class voters peeled away from the Democrats. Kamala Harris won the most affluent voters, while Trump took those earning between $50,000 (39,000) and $100,000 (77,000). The two tied for those on $50,000 and below. So much for Harris being part of the most pro-worker government since the 1960s. Just as the electorate professed fury with the entire political and economic system, she and the Democrats made themselves the system's defenders. They weren't change but more of the same. They worried
2024110618282	about the future of 'democracy'; they warned about disrupting free trade. Harris's slogan of 'we're not going back' said it all: a campaign defined by being anti-Trump rather than for anything. A strategy intended to woo 'moderates' left nearly everyone cold. Harris started her campaign differently, by promising to hunt down price-gouging corporates. That policy was popular, but there was little else. She went policy-lite, so as to present Trump with less of a target. Among the supporters she wheeled out this autumn was the billionaire Mark Cuban. In a country where the richest 0.1% own nearly 20% of all wealth - almost as much as 90% of Americans put together - this is almost the definition of anti-populist politics. We probably won't hear much about billionaires over the next few days. If the commentariat's form from 2016 is anything to go by, the sketch will be of angry left-behinds and rednecks rallying to a strongman. Never mind that last night's exit polls showed Trump as personally less popular than Harris, or that more than half of voters judge his views to be 'too extreme'. Not to mention that Trump is easily the richest man ever to serve in the White House, with a personal net worth of about $5.5bn (4.3bn). A marketing man, skilled at targeting discontent, Trump does not follow his crowds. Rather, he is led by the money men around him: the fossil fuel executives, the shadow bankers, the crypto bros and the world's richest man, Elon Musk. Mitt Romney and George W Bush could always rely on some stuffed shirts from the Fortune 500 to hand over a few tens of thousands. But Trump's donor class is very different. They include men like Stephen Schwarzman, head of the world's largest private equity firm, Blackstone, billionaire investor Nelson Peltz and Silicon Valley's David Sacks. They're not company men building relationships but, as Trump styles himself, dealmakers. This lot have shelled out a lot more to get in Trump (Musk alone has spent an estimated $100m), and expect their money's worth. 'They're less concerned about the photo op and a visit to the White House,' as one former bagman for Trump told the New Yorker. 'They want to essentially get their issues in the White House.' Trump has reportedly lined up Musk to become his 'secretary of cost cutting', while in April, the US's next president demanded oil executives give him $1bn to beat the Democrats. In return, he said, he'd let them do a lot more drilling. Slashed regulations and lower taxes are Trump's way of keeping donors on side. Last time he was in the White House, he brought in $1.5tn of tax cuts that meant the richest 400 families in the US paid a lower tax rate than their secretaries, nannies, cleaners and anyone else in the working class. You can expect a lot more like it over the next four years. Trump will almost certainly plunder from the budgets for social security and Medicaid. The tech bros will suckle on government subsidies, while the suits from private equity get to set government policy. However this politics dresses itself, it's not populism.

2024110619171	Vice President Kamala Harris, who called and congratulated President-elect Donald Trump on his victory in the 2024 presidential election, is expected to make a speech Wednesday afternoon from Howard University in Washington, D.C. The Democratic presidential nominee will deliver the speech at 4 p.m. ET, the White House confirmed. Harris had been expected to address her election night party Tuesday night at the historically Black college where she was an undergraduate. However, as voting results came in, it became clear early Wednesday morning Trump would ultimately win a second term in the White House. Polls prior to Election Day showed Harris and Trump in a neck-and-neck race. But former President Donald Trump prevailed in a decisive victory, winning all seven battleground states - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - that for weeks had been considered considered a tossup. Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July following a poor performance against former President Donald Trump in a June 27 presidential debate. Sign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team. During her three-month campaign, Harris faced the challenges of an unpopular President Joe Biden, whose disapproval ratings in exit polls Tuesday rated about 41%. The Harris campaign and Democratic party fundraising committees set fundraising records including raising more than $1 billion since Harris became the nominee. Many billionaires including Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg also supported Harris. (Elon Musk was among those who supported Trump.)

Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to give what will likely be her official concession speech Wednesday afternoon. 24/7 Chicago news stream: Watch NBC 5 free wherever you are Harris will address the nation for the first time since overnight calls projected Donald Trump will become the next president-elect. Her address is set to take place at 3 p.m. CT at Howard University in Washington D.C., her alma mater. Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff will also be in attendance. Live coverage of the address will appear in the player above as it begins. The address comes after a Harris campaign spokesperson said the vice president would not be speaking on election night. 'We still have votes to count. We still have states that have not been called yet. We will continue overnight to try to make sure that every vote is counted, that every voice has spoken,' campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond said on election night. 'So you won't hear from the vice president tonight. But you will hear from her tomorrow, because she will back here tomorrow to address not only the HU family, not only to address her supporters, but to address the nation.' Around 4:30 a.m. Wednesday, NBC News projected Trump would become the next President-elect after clinching Wisconsin's 10 Electoral College votes. Those votes put Trump over the edge to secure 276 electoral votes, surpassing the 270 electoral votes needed to win. The president-elect will also have at least Republican control of the Senate as well. Previously, Democrats held a narrow majority in the senate. Meanwhile, the House is still very much in play. When Trump takes the oath of office, he will become just the second person in history to serve two non-consecutive terms in the White House, joining Grover Cleveland in that group. Trump told the audience at his election night party early on Wednesday that it was 'time to unite' as a country. 'It's time to put the divisions of the past four years behind us,' Trump said. 'It's time to unite.' 'We have to put our country first for at least a period of time,' he added. 'We have to fix it.' He promised that he would 'not rest until we have delivered the strong safe and prosperous America.' 'Every single day,' Trump said, 'I will be fighting for you with every breath in my body.'

2024110620061	Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a speech Wednesday afternoon a few hours after officially conceding in a phone call to President-elect Donald Trump. Harris, who became the Democratic presidential nominee after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July, delivered the speech at 4 p.m. ET from Howard University in Washington, D.C., the White House confirmed. Trump came out ahead of Harris in a hard-fought campaign that ended with Trump's decisive victory in which he captured several battleground states including North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Harris did not make a speech during her election night party Tuesday night at Howard University, a historically Black college where she was an undergraduate. As voting returns came in, it became clear early Wednesday morning Trump would ultimately win a second term in the White House. Sign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.

2024110621581	By Ted Johnson Political Editor Facing a crowd of supporters, a number of them wiping away tears, Kamala Harris delivered a concession speech Wednesday in which she urged them to not despair and not give up at a critical period in American history. 'To everyone who is watching: Do not despair. This is not a time to throw up our hands. This is a time to roll up our sleeves,' Harris said to the crowd at Howard University. Many in the crowd were at the same place Tuesday night, hopeful that it would be a victory celebration for winning the 2024 presidential election. Instead, the mood turned grim when it was apparent that the election was shifting Donald Trump's way. Harris made a point of noting that, in her phone call with Trump today, she told him that 'we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power,' a contrast to the president-elect's refusal to do so four years ago. 'A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results,' Harris said. 'That principle, as much as any other, distinguishes democracy from monarchy or tyranny, and anyone who seeks to public trust must honor it.' 'At the same time, in our nation, we owe loyalty not to a president or a party but to the Constitution of the United States,' she said. Harris encouraged her supporters to 'never give up.' 'While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign,' she said. Harris was joined by her husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, and her running mate, Tim Walz, who was there with his wife Gwen. 'There's an adage an historian once called a law of history, true of every society across the ages,' Harris said. 'The adage is, 'Only when it is dark enough can you see the stars.' I know many people feel like we are entering a dark time, but for the benefit of us all, I hope that is not the case. But here's the thing, America, if it is, let us fill the sky with the light of a brilliant billion of stars, the light of optimism, of faith, of truth and service.' Later, President Joe Biden issued a statement on Harris. 'What America saw today was the Kamala Harris I know and deeply admire. She's been a tremendous partner and public servant full of integrity, courage, and character. Under extraordinary circumstances, she stepped up and led a historic campaign that embodied what's possible when guided by a strong moral compass and a clear vision for a nation that is more free, more just, and full of more opportunities for all Americans. 'As I've said before, selecting Kamala was the very first decision I made when I became the nominee for president in 2020. It was the best decision I made. Her story represents the best of America's story. And as she made clear today, I have no doubt that she'll continue writing that story. 'She will continue the fight with purpose, determination, and joy. She will continue to be a champion for all Americans. Above all, she will continue to be a leader our children will look up to for generations to come as she puts her stamp on America's future.' Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

WASHINGTON - Kamala Harris said Wednesday that 'we must accept the results of this election' as she encouraged supporters to continue fighting for their vision of the country after her loss to Donald Trump. The Democratic vice president said the battle would continue 'in the voting booth, in the courts and in the public square.' 'Sometimes the fight takes a while,' she said. 'That doesn't mean we won't win.' Harris delivered her remarks at Howard University, her alma mater and one of the country's most prominent historically Black schools, in the same spot where she hoped to give a victory speech. 'While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign,' Harris said. Her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, was in the audience. So were Reps. Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker, and Barbara Lee, both from Harris' home state of California. Before her speech, Harris called Trump to concede the election and congratulate him on his victory. She said, 'We will engage in a peaceful transfer of power.' Harris, once viewed as a potential savior for the Democratic Party after Joe Biden 's reelection campaign stalled, is reckoning with a profound rejection by American voters in this year's presidential election. She trailed in every battleground state to Trump, a man she described as an existential danger to the country's foundational institutions. And Trump appeared on track to win the popular vote for the first time in his three campaigns for the White House - even after two impeachments, felony convictions and his attempt to overturn his previous election loss. Biden plans to address the election results on Thursday. The White House said he spoke with Harris and Trump on Wednesday, and he invited the president-elect to meet with him soon. Biden released a statement praising Harris after her speech, saying: 'She will continue the fight with purpose, determination, and joy. She will continue to be a champion for all Americans. Above all, she will continue to be a leader our children will look up to for generations to come as she puts her stamp on America's future.' David Plouffe, a top Harris adviser, said campaign staffers 'left it all on the field for their country.' 'We dug out of a deep hole but not enough,' he said. 'A devastating loss.' Election Day 2024: Live results in Illinois In a bitter footnote for Harris, as the sitting vice president she is expected to oversee Congress' ceremonial certification of the election. It's the same role Mike Pence played four years ago, when Trump directed his supporters to march on the U.S. Capitol. Although critics said the violent insurrection crystallized Trump's threat to American democracy, that ultimately did not dissuade voters from electing him again. Harris became the Democratic candidate after Biden, who was already struggling to convince voters that he could serve as president until he was 86 years old, stumbled badly in his June 27 debate with Trump. Donald Trump shatters 'Blue Wall' by winning Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to take the White House He dropped out of the race on July 21 and endorsed his vice president, who
2024110623132	swiftly unified the Democratic Party around her candidacy. It was a remarkable twist of fate for Harris. Four years earlier, her own presidential campaign had flamed out and revealed the political limitations of someone once dubbed 'the female Barack Obama.' Even though Biden chose Harris as his running mate, she languished in the role after taking office as the first woman, Black person or person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president. Some Democrats started writing her off when they pondered the party's future after Biden. But Harris found fresh purpose after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, and she became the White House's leading advocate for abortion rights. Harris also made a more concerted effort to network with local politicians, business leaders and cultural figures, forging connections that could serve her down the road. The moment arrived sooner than she anticipated, and she was catapulted into the presidential race with Biden's departure only a month before the Democratic National Convention. Harris instantly reset the terms of the contest with Trump. She was 18 years younger and a former courtroom prosecutor going up against the first major presidential candidate convicted of crimes. Her candidacy energized Democrats who feared they were destined for defeat with Biden at the top of the ticket. But she also faced steep odds from the beginning. She inherited Biden's political operation with just 107 days until the end of the election, and she faced a restless electorate that was eager for change. Although Harris pitched 'a new way forward,' she struggled to meaningfully differentiate herself from the unpopular sitting president. In addition, she had limited time to introduce herself to skeptical voters, who never cast a ballot for her in a presidential primary. Democrats now face the prospect of picking up the pieces during a second Trump presidency, and it's unclear what role Harris will play in her party's future. 'The work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump Presidency starts now,' wrote Jen O'Malley Dillon, Harris' campaign chair, in a letter to staff. 'I know the Vice President isn't finished in this fight, and I know the very people on this email are also going to be leaders in this collective mission.'

2024110621531	By Gene Maddaus Senior Media Writer Kamala Harris conceded the presidential race on Wednesday afternoon, telling supporters at Howard University in Washington, D.C. 'do not despair,' and urging them to keep fighting at the ballot box and in the courts. Harris began by saying she would work with President Trump to ensure a peaceful transfer of power, drawing an unspoken contrast with the violence and chaos of four years ago. 'We must accept the results of this election,' she said. 'A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election we accept the results.' But, she added, that does not mean she will concede the fight for 'freedom, opportunity, dignity and fairness' that animated her campaign. 'We owe loyalty not to a president or a party, but to the Constitution of the United States,' she said. Harris spoke in front of a cheering crowd at her alma mater. Among those on hand were former Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Tim Walz, her running mates, as well as the candidates' families. At the close of her speech, she invoked Howard's motto - 'truth and service' - saying it was important to overcome setbacks. 'I know many people feel like we are entering a dark time,' she said. 'For the benefit of us all, I hope that is not the case.' Harris acknowledged that her younger supporters may be feeling 'sad or disappointed.' 'But please know it's going to be OK,' she said. 'Sometimes the fight takes a while. That doesn't mean we won't win. The important thing is don't ever give up.' 0 Comments Comments are moderated.

2024110621561	The vice president addressed the nation from her alma mater, Howard University. Vice President Kamala Harris said her heart is 'full of resolve' after losing the presidential election to former President Donald Trump. 'My heart is full today -- full of gratitude for the trust you have placed in me, full of love for our country, and full of resolve,' Harris said Wednesday at her alma mater, Howard University, in Washington, D.C. 'The outcome of this election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for. But ... the light of America's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up,' Harris said. WATCH: Kamala Harris' full concession speech Harris said she told Trump on the phone Wednesday that she'll help with a peaceful transfer of power, which got a cheer from the crowd at Howard. 'We must accept the results of this election,' she said. Harris stressed, 'While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign.' 'The fight for freedom, for opportunity, for fairness and the dignity of all people -- a fight for the ideals at the heart of our nation -- the ideals that reflect America at our best,' she said. Harris vowed that she'll 'never give up the fight for a future ... where the women of America have the freedom to make decisions about their own body.' 'We will never give up the fight to protect our schools and our streets from gun violence,' she continued. 'And America, we will never give up the fight for our democracy, for the rule of law, for equal justice, and for the sacred idea that every one of us, no matter who we are or where we start out, has certain fundamental rights and freedoms that must be respected and upheld.' She said that fight will continue not just out loud, but also 'in quieter ways.' 'In how we live our lives: by treating one another with kindness and respect, by looking in the face of a stranger and seeing a neighbor,' she said. 'By always using our strength to lift people up, to fight for the dignity that all people deserve.' To young Americans watching, the vice president said, 'It's OK to feel sad and disappointed. But please know, it's gonna be OK.' To her young supporters watching, the vice president said, 'It is OK to feel sad and disappointed, but please know it's gonna be OK.' 'Sometimes the fight takes a while. ... The important thing is don't ever give up,' she said. 'This is not a time to throw up our hands, this is a time to roll up our sleeves. This is a time to organize, to mobilize and to stay engaged for the sake of freedom and justice and the future that we all know we can build together,' she said. Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff waved to the crowd after her remarks as Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, looked on. Harris' defeat came as Trump won the swing states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Wisconsin overnight. Trump won another swing state, Michigan, on Wednesday. Trump's victory underscores just how deep voters' frustrations were surrounding inflation and immigration, Republicans' two top issues this election cycle as polls consistently showed Americans' unhappiness with how President Joe Biden handled them. Trump's return to the White House also suggests that Democrats were not motivated enough by the prospect of electing the first female president and that its base's fury over the Supreme Court's revocation of constitutional abortion protections has waned since 2022. Harris had an extremely hurried campaign, which began this summer when Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed his vice president.

There's an adage an historian once called a law of history true of every society across the ages. The adage is: Only when it is dark enough, can you see the stars. I know many people feel like we are entering a dark time. But for the benefit of us all, I hope that is not the case. But here's the thing, America, if it is, let us fill the sky with the light of a brilliant, brilliant billion of stars. The light, the light of optimism, of faith, of truth and service. By Nicholas Nehamas and Erica L. Green Reporting from Howard University Vice President Kamala Harris formally acknowledged her loss to President-elect Donald J. Trump on Wednesday in a defiant and emotional speech, defending her campaign as a fight for democracy that she would continue, even if not from the Oval Office. 'While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign,' Ms. Harris said. 'Hear me when I say, the light of America's promise will always burn bright,' she added. 'As long as we never give up. And as long as we keep fighting.' Ms. Harris, her voice cracking with emotion at times, made the final speech of her presidential campaign at Howard University, her alma mater, in Washington. The results, still trickling in as Ms. Harris spoke, showed her on track to lose both the national popular vote and the top seven battleground states. Ms. Harris ran a 107-day campaign under extraordinarily rare circumstances after President Biden dropped out of the race and she ricocheted to the top of the Democratic ticket. But burdened by the legacy of her incumbency, the history of a nation that was reluctant to elect a woman of color, and her unwillingness to articulate a meaningful separation from the unpopular Biden administration, Ms. Harris lost ground among most major groups of voters. Her 12-minute concession was more than Mr. Trump ever offered to President Biden and Ms. Harris after they defeated him in 2020. To this day, Mr. Trump has not conceded that race, in public or private. Now, he returns to the White House after a resounding win, still technically facing federal charges over his attempts to overturn the election four years ago. On Wednesday, in what seemed a pointed reminder, Ms. Harris said she had called Mr. Trump earlier in the day to offer her congratulations - but also to promise that the Biden administration would 'engage in a peaceful transfer of power.' 'A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results,' she said. 'That principle, as much as any other, distinguishes democracy from monarchy or tyranny, and anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it.' Many of her female supporters were crying as they left the campus's grassy quad, known as the Yard. Against the backdrop of Frederick Douglass Memorial Hall, Ms. Harris used her speech to encourage generations behind her not to be deterred by the outcome of her barrier-breaking campaign. 'Don't you ever listen when anyone tells you something is impossible because it has never been done before,' said Ms.
2024110622092	Harris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to ascend as the nominee of a major political party. 'You have the capacity to do extraordinary good in the world. And so to everyone who is watching, do not despair. This is not a time to throw up our hands. This is a time to roll up our sleeves.' When she delivered her speech on Wednesday, Ms. Harris thanked Mr. Biden, who was watching from the West Wing, as well as her family and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota. Mr. Walz stood off to the side, grimacing and seeming on the verge of tears. Doug Emhoff, her husband, embraced their daughter, Ella. Ms. Harris also took a moment to address the young people watching. 'It is OK to feel sad and disappointed, but please know it's going to be OK,' she said. 'On the campaign, I would often say, 'When we fight, we win.' But here's the thing, here's the thing: Sometimes the fight takes a while. That doesn't mean we won't win.' The crowd of supporters gathered at Howard was far sparser than the one that had awaited her on Tuesday evening for her election night party, hoping to witness a historic victory. Jack Ludd, 79, had missed the watch party because he was tired after his fourth trip to Pennsylvania canvassing for the Harris campaign, but he showed up to hear Ms. Harris concede. Resting on the seat of his walker as he waited for the vice president, he said he felt 'afraid' about the prospect of four more years under Mr. Trump. 'I don't know what to expect,' said Mr. Ludd, a retired taxi driver from Washington. 'I depend on Social Security.' But he was not entirely surprised by her defeat. On his canvassing trips, Mr. Ludd said, 'the buses were almost empty.' Kadidra Hurst also traveled to Howard on Wednesday to show Ms. Harris her appreciation, although she knew that the crowd would not be as big as Tuesday's. 'I wanted Kamala to know that I still support her,' Ms. Hurst said. 'I think really, we need a message of, what do we do next? And I feel like she gave us that - that we continue to fight we, we keep our foot on the gas.' Her 5-year-old daughter, Tasmin Hurst, said it was 'very good' to see Ms. Harris onstage. She said she was sad about the loss, saying Mr. Trump was 'very not a nice man.' Adriane Lowrie was brought to tears as she talked about seeing Ms. Harris leave the stage one last time. 'All that she did to fight,' Ms. Lowrie said, wiping away tears. 'It's just sad, the state of our country is so divided.' The night before, thousands of people had gathered with high enthusiasm at Howard, watching CNN on giant outdoor screens. They cheered and waved American flags when good news came in for Ms. Harris, like her unsurprising victory in California. But when the results from the battleground states showed up, the crowd was largely silent as an anchor ticked through Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina - she trailed in all - only celebrating when her soon-to-evaporate lead in Michigan was announced. Later in the evening, the Harris campaign shut off the sound to the television screens and started playing music after a CNN guest remarked that the election felt 'more like 2016 than 2020.' Ms. Harris's sorority sisters, clad in the pink and green of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, streamed slowly out of the campus. One broke her prayer to decline to speak with a reporter. Just before Ms. Harris officially lost Georgia, the song she chose for her campaign, 'Freedom,' by Beyonce - an ode to the journey of liberation of Black women from slavery - began blaring through loudspeakers.

'I don't know what the future holds at this point,' Ms. Dowd said. 'I think the world is scared of a woman leading the country, let alone a Black woman. That's just what we face.

2024110701441	The election is over. Vice President Kamala Harris lost and former President Donald Trump won. How did this happen? People are going to point fingers. Harris inherited President Biden's political team with some of former President Barack Obama's team bolted on, and they will all be very eager to divorce themselves from the loss. The less thoughtful will point to misogyny or racism or some combination. Yet while I'm sure the country's first woman president will experience a different kind of scrutiny, the real cause of the Dems' loss was their refusal to hold a nomination process. President Biden's refusal to step down and allow a primary in January of this year is why the Democrats lost. If a primary had taken place, Josh Shapiro, Gavin Newsom, Gretchen Whitmer, J.B. Pritzker, Wes Moore, Andy Beshear, and others would have run alongside Kamala. The result would have been a strong nominee chosen by voters in a competitive process. If it had been Kamala-which you'd have to consider unlikely, based on her 2019 run-she would have been a different candidate who would have done scores of interviews and been fully prepped and toughened. Kamala had well-established weaknesses. One is that she was attached to the current administration with all of its drawbacks. Another is that she struggles with sit-down interviews. When asked a question, she seems to be thinking, 'What should I say here?' instead of, 'What do I think and believe?' That's a critical flaw. Her team managed to avoid this in the presidential race for a while by focusing on the DNC speech and the debate, but eventually she had no choice but to conduct interviews, and the results were uneven at best. If your candidate can't win people over by talking to them or in front of them, it's a major problem. By the way, I don't think this is that big a deal ordinarily. Many politicians are kind of unmemorable and resort to talking points whenever they sit down. But in a presidential campaign, it's glaring. People expect the President to be a strong leader and communicator, and talking points seem scripted and inauthentic. This is one reason why Kamala's campaign in 2019 didn't go well. Again, that's what a nomination process is for. President Biden insisting that he was running only to drop out belatedly after his disastrous June debate and then endorse Harris short-circuited any chance for the party to meaningfully vet a candidate and field the strongest ticket. There was one member of Congress who tried to force a nomination contest: Dean Phillips of Minnesota. His reward was a premature end to his political career and endless stories maligning his character. Dean tried to save the party from itself, but it didn't want to be saved; instead, it chanted 'foyr more years' at a visibly declining 81-year old Joe Biden, who would drop out six months later. A genuine nomination process would have made the Democratic Party seem much more functional, because, well, it would have been. Voters would have spoken, and the best candidates would have emerged. That never happened. Even after Kamala Harris was the nominee, they could have gone bolder. She could have shown daylight between herself and Joe Biden on multiple fronts. I would have considered accepting RFK Jr.'s endorsement and giving him a role in trying to clean up food additives. Many of his followers are sincere. The Dems refused to take his call. I would have named Mitt Romney Secretary of State. As far as I know they never had that conversation. I would have said, 'Ordinary Americans are fed up with bureaucracy. Democrats should be
2024110701442	trying to deliver services efficiently. I will name a task force to minimize waste and deliver results.' Take some of Elon's thunder. Who likes bureaucracy? Accept some of the grievances Americans have as being in good faith, and make yourself someone who redefines party orthodoxy to build a bigger tent. But to do these things it would take someone-either the candidate or the campaign manager-with a real vision. The candidate matters. If your candidate is a particular person with real strengths and weaknesses, you can't make them into a different person or swap them out (more than once). There were also issues with Harris inheriting Biden's team and campaign; there wasn't a multi-year arc of trust built up. I don't think the campaign team had confidence in Kamala to take on certain tasks. And instead of figuring out how to grow to a win, the strategy became trying to eke out a narrow win that eventually turned into a loss, despite a massive fundraising advantage. Tons of campaign time was spent on raising money for ads that never moved the needle. There's a lesson there too. Now the Democratic Party will say, 'It's okay, we'll come back in '28!' Consultants will burnish their resumes by throwing someone else under the bus. Profiles will be written about the next crop of candidates for what they hope will be the next election. Will they learn? Why would you imagine so after witnessing this year? Fundamentally, the party has become insular-more concerned about itself than the people and families it pretends to represent. Conformity ruled over courage or common sense. Enough Americans have lost faith to give the reins of power back to Donald Trump. No one should walk away from this thinking that the situation is tenable. The question should not be 'Who's next?' but instead 'What is next?' Everything, including a new political party that gets us beyond the tedious us vs. them, should be on the table.

2024110623081	Vice President Kamala Harris conceded the 2024 presidential election to President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday in an impassioned speech focused on the work that still must be done to 'make the world a better place,' not unlike the concession speech former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave in 2016. Trump, the Republican nominee, was declared the winner of the presidency by The Associated Press (AP) early Wednesday morning when he pushed over the required threshold of 270 Electoral College votes. So far, he beat Harris, the Democratic nominee, in the swing states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia and North Carolina and 23 Republican-leaning states. He also secured four of the five electoral votes in Nebraska and one in Maine, bringing his total to 295 Electoral College votes. Harris thanked her supporters, telling them, 'My heart is full today' as she made the final speech of her campaign at her alma mater, Howard University in Washington D.C. Almost eight years to the day, Clinton, the Democratic nominee at the time, gave a similar speech at the New Yorker Hotel, telling her supporters, 'I feel pride and gratitude' after losing the Electoral College 232-306 to Trump. Newsweek reached out to Clinton's office as well as Harris and Trump's campaigns via email for comment on Wednesday evening. Harris mentioned on Wednesday that she spoke with Trump earlier in the day to congratulate him on his win. 'I also told him that we will help him and his team with their transition and that we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power,' Harris said. In 2016, Clinton also said she had congratulated Trump and 'offered to work with him on behalf of our country.' 'Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power and we don't just respect that, we cherish it,' Clinton said. Harris focused more on accepting the election results than Clinton did, presumably because in 2020 when Trump lost to now-President Joe Biden, he did not and still does not accept the election results. For four years, Trump has repeatedly claimed that Biden's election victory was stolen via widespread voter fraud despite there being no evidence of this. He has also never conceded the 2020 race to Biden. 'I know folks are feeling and experiencing a range of emotions right now. I get it. But we must accept the results of this election,' Harris said on Wednesday. 'A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results. That principle as much as any other distinguishes democracy from monarchy or tyranny. And anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it.' She continued: 'At the same time, in our nation, we owe loyalty, not to a president or a party, but to the Constitution of the United States. And loyalty to our conscience and to our God. My allegiance to all three is why I am here to say, while I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign. The fight for freedom, for opportunity, for fairness and the dignity of all people.' Harris mentioned a touchstone of her campaign during her concession speech-women's reproductive rights. 'I will never give up the fight for a future where Americans can pursue their dreams, ambitions and aspirations. Where the women of America have the freedom to make decisions about their own body and not have their government telling them what to do,' she said. Harris made it a point to address the young people watching her speech. 'To the young people who are watching, it is okay to feel sad and disappointed but please know it's going to be
2024110623082	okay. On the campaign, I would often say, 'When we fight, We win.' But here's the thing, sometimes the fight takes a while. That doesn't mean we won't win,' she said. 'The important thing is don't ever give up. Don't ever stop trying to make the world a better place. You have power. And don't you ever listen when anyone tells you something is impossible because it has never been done before.' Clinton also specifically called out to young people and women in her 2016 concession speech. 'To the young people in particular, I hope you will hear this. I have...spent my entire adult life fighting for what I believe in. I've had successes, and I've had setbacks. Sometimes, really painful ones. Many of you are at the beginning of your professional public and political careers. You will have successes and setbacks, too,' she said. 'This loss hurts, but please never stop believing that fighting for what's right is worth it.' She continued: 'We need you to keep up these fights now and for the rest of your lives. And to all the women, and especially the young women, who put their faith in this campaign and in me, I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion. 'I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but some day someone will and hopefully sooner than we might think right now. And to all the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams.'

2024110706441	San Francisco is reeling. This was where Kamala Harris, the US vice-president, cut her political teeth and rose up through the ranks - and has formed the basis of her political and financial support for the last three decades. 'There's existential silence today,' said Gil Duran, who worked with Harris in the attorney-general's office in Sacramento. 'And all flavours of panic. People are realising this was a massive miscalculation of epic proportions.' Duran, 48, does not see any political way forward for Harris.

2024110621581	WASHINGTON - Vice President Kamala Harris conceded the 2024 presidential election during a speech to dejected supporters on the campus of Howard University late Wednesday afternoon while vowing to keep fighting against a 'dark time' for some Americans. Harris, 60, addressed a subdued crowd at her alma mater's main quad, known as 'The Yard,' at about 4:25 p.m. - roughly 16 hours after campaign staff announced early Wednesday morning that she would not speak at an election watch party, prompting a mass exodus from the once-bustling event packed with thousands of students and young activists. 'I know many people feel like we're entering a dark time,' Harris said. 'But for the benefit of us all, I hope that's not the case.' Harris acknowledged former president turned President-elect Donald Trump, who regained the White House overnight Wednesday in a stunning political comeback, won the election to become the 47th U.S. president, spoiling her own quest to hold the nation's highest office as the first female and woman of color. 'My heart is full today, full of gratitude,' she told several thousand supporters in a concession speech peppered with optimism. 'Hear me when I say the light of America's promise will always burn bright.' Harris, whose rise to the Democratic nomination followed President Biden's withdrawal from the race in late July, did not publicly signal her political future on Wednesday as the outgoing vice president, but said Americans 'must accept' results of the election. She promised to 'never give up' her desire to protect citizens of all backgrounds. 'We will never give up the fight for our democracy, the rule of law, of the rule of justice and the sacred idea that everyone of us, no matter who we are or where we start out, have certain fundamental rights and freedoms that must be upheld,' Harris said. 'We will continue to wage this fight.' Harris said she called President-elect Trump earlier Wednesday to concede the race and work with President Biden to ensure a smooth transition of power. 'She also made clear that she hopes he will be a president for all Americans,' Harris' campaign manager, Jen O'Malley Dillon, reportedly told staff in an email, adding that the vice president and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, would speak directly to all campaign staffers. 'I'll leave you with this: losing is incredibly painful,' O'Malley Dillon continued. 'It is hard. This will take a long time to process. But the work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump presidency starts now.' Steven Cheung, Trump's campaign communications director, confirmed Harris congratulated the Republican on the 'historic' victory, propelling the 78-year-old back to the White House for a second time. 'President Trump acknowledged Vice President Harris on her strength, professionalism, and tenacity throughout the campaign, and both leaders agreed on the importance of unifying the country,' Cheung said in a statement to Newsweek. Trump's lopsided victory in the race, which had been expected by many observers to be an extremely tight contest, serves as a stunning blow for Democrats and Harris, who declined to speak late Tuesday at the watch party attended primarily by current and former Howard University students. She graduated from the historically black college in 1986, four years after first walking onto grounds of 'The Mecca' to follow in the footsteps of Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and further cultivate her lifelong interest in law. While at Howard, Harris majored in political science and economics and served as a
2024110621582	freshman student council representative. She also joined the debate team and pledged Alpha Kappa Alpha, a prestigious sorority founded at the historically black college in 1908. Harris characterized the university as 'home' in a 2021 Instagram post, recalling her time decades earlier protesting apartheid in South Africa alongside other young political activists and Howard students along the National Mall. 'For me, Howard is home,' Harris wrote. 'At Howard, you can be a football player and a valedictorian. You can be a budding computer scientist and a poet. You can have a 4.0, intern on Capitol Hill, and still find time to hang out with friends on the weekend.' At Tuesday's watch party, prior to the race being called, many supporters were cautiously optimistic despite returns reflecting Trump's growing lead that never relented. 'We're really proud to support her and the impact that she's made thus far, regardless of the outcome,' Howard University junior Ajoi Adams, 20, told Newsweek late Tuesday prior to Trump's win. 'It's not over until God says it's over.' Sana-Alyse Muhammad, 23, who graduated from Howard University with a psychology degree last year, said she proudly voted for her fellow Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority member. 'I'm overwhelmed with pride,' Muhammad told Newsweek late Tuesday steps from the university's main quad as she awaited election returns during Harris' watch party. 'I have so much hope and I think we can bring it home.' Muhammad said had been constantly checking news sites for election updates and felt anxious yet hopeful about the prospect of a Howard University graduate like herself capturing the White House. 'We've been reading up on the 'red mirage,'' Muhammad said. 'But we just need to give it time for those votes to come in.' Some of Harris' backers at Tuesday's watch party, however, were dismayed that she chose not to speak, despite the bleak outlook as Trump racked up wins across the country, particularly in battleground states. 'I'll say this, it was bad form for Kamala Harris to skip addressing supporters last night at Howard University,' Troy Donte Prestwood wrote on X early Wednesday. 'Many of us stood for hours eating dry granola & listening to a bad DJ. We knew the results weren't looking good. At least thank your supporters.' Harris closed her remarks Wednesday acknowledging the pain of the lopsided loss. 'To the young people who are watching, it is OK to feel sad and disappointed,' she said. 'But please know it is going to be okay. On the campaign, I would often say when we fight, we win. But here's the thing, here's the thing. Sometimes the fight takes awhile. That doesn't mean we won't win. The important thing is don't ever give up.' Joshua Rhett Miller is a Newsweek chief investigative reporter based in New York.

2024110612491	Vice President Kamala Harris lost her campaign for president overnight, breaking the hearts of many, including my wife Caron and four-year-old daughter Cross, who have both fiercely advocated for her victory from the beginning. They are gutted, their spirits are down; my spirit is down. America's decision is nauseating. But we are still America. We are still here, and the fight for freedom must go on. We must push forward. To be completely honest, seeing a man who is proudly against women having the right to choose what to do with their own bodies in 2024 win a national election is beyond devastating. It proves that our country has no interest in loving women. To think, women in America are CEOs, top physicians at elite medical institutions, judges, mechanics, bodybuilders and astronauts -- women birth us, they raise us and have proved they have the power to do anything a man can do. That they still can't claim the title of president is beyond me. The only word that comes to mind is sad. Related While I watch my wife and daughter process the results, I hurt for them. I'm reminded of what the significance of having a Black woman claim her seat in the White House would have meant for them. What it would have meant to me. Because I'll admit, I didn't always understand the power of symbolism. As a boy born in the 1980s, I wasn't taught to pay attention to the chokehold that the patriarchy has on women. We boys were taught to exist as men and defend that, to hold onto the idea that we are leaders and authority figures, even if we didn't earn it. Questions about qualifications didn't even cross our minds. And even as we grew up and some of us began identifying as good guys, we probably still talked over women or questioned the things we learned from them - treated them in ways we just wouldn't a man. There's a good chance our positions at work could have been given to more qualified women. But these things don't cross our minds because they don't have to. I began learning about the role gender plays in my place in society in high school. Trump is in his 70s and he still doesn't get it, but he gets to be president - if privilege were a person, he'd be it. While I watch my wife and daughter process the results, I hurt for them. I'm reminded of what the significance of having a Black woman claim her seat in the White House would have meant for them. As I've grown, I have been actively working to unlearn this inherited behavior. It wasn't until I settled down with my wife Caron and began to build a home that I realized the problem was worse than I imagined. Watching Caron navigate her profession opened my eyes to how the patriarchy can affect a woman every day of her life. Like Harris, Caron is a lawyer, HBCU graduate and Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority sister. She has been talking about what was on the other side of that glass ceiling since the day the vice president announced her candidacy. Like Harris, Caron has led organizations, directed large staffs and earned her way to the top, but her accomplishments have not been recognized in the same ways a man's would. It's a reality she shares with many women - always being called to solve the problem and rarely getting credit after she does. Related Harris represented the idea of overcoming all of that, and I pray we don't lose that feeling. Seeing Caron's enthusiasm for Harris trickling down to our four-year-old daughter, Cross, was magic. Throughout the campaign season, Cross marched around the house, saying, 'Don Trumpet is a bad boy. He will lose. Comma-la will win, win, win!' The first time we
2024110612492	heard our daughter's anti-Trump rant earlier in the year, around the time VP Harris became the presumptive nominee, we laughed, not knowing where it came from. Maybe her feisty grandmas on both sides, who were also anticipating this day, taught her that. As November 5 approached, Cross' convictions grew stronger. 'Donald Trumpet is a nasty man, he's trashy,' Cross screamed in her sweet little voice. 'Comma-la will win!' And now we have to sit her down and tell her that America chose a person who is anti-woman. What hurts more is that I hear men - so-called progressives - champion women every day while doing nothing meaningful to help propel them through sexist spaces. Male leaders from every demographic talk about the power of women, but do they hold space for them? They champion women in leadership as an idea, but what do they do to make it a reality? I saw Black and Brown men, from my own community, who were raised by their single mothers and single grandmas, scream for ' Trump!' I don't get it. Are they delusional, or do they hate women, or both? This loss is even more personal for me, considering the battles I watched many women in my life take on. As a teenager, I watched my mother, a talented phlebotomist, be robbed of promotions at Johns Hopkins Hospital where she worked for 20 years. She was often responsible for training the person who would be supervising her. I watched my grandma run our family full of dysfunctional men who were completely lost after she died. While alive, she was never acknowledged for her leadership. They both had to find a way to survive in Trump's America. Sadly, we are still there. What's even more sad is that I was not surprised. What hurts more is that I hear men - so-called progressives - champion women every day while doing nothing meaningful to help propel them through sexist spaces. Throughout this entire campaign, Caron and Cross remained beyond confident. The two were delicate like bombs whenever they witnessed anyone displaying the slightest bit of uncertainty. I couldn't help being skeptical, though, because I remember in 2016, thinking Hillary Clinton was going to have this moment. Her skill set says she should have won, but America has a history of getting it wrong. In 2016, we got it very wrong. So yes, I was terrified. I was terrified because America has a way of ignoring blatant racism. As if Trump never took out that ad advocating for the Central Park 5 to be executed; as if he hasn't flirted with Nazi-style imagery and references; as if he never said there were good people on both sides in Charlottesville even though one side united to celebrate and praise hate; as if he never called countries that were full of proud people of color sh**holes. I was terrified. The low morale of Democrats while Biden ran for reelection was haunting. There was no energy, little celebrity movement, few campaign signs and cheeky bumper stickers. It felt like we weren't in election season and that was terrifying. Political conversations in my friend groups, which are filled with hard-working people who care about the progress of this country, ended with nothing more than shrugs about voting for Biden again. No one was offering to host a campaign dinner, no one was rocking a Biden hoodie, and definitely no one was sending out emails or knocking on any doors. But smart people know excitement wins elections. And Trump had all of the excitement until the Kamala effect. It was telling when Harris announced her candidacy and a collection of blue and white campaign signs flooded every liberal district, seemingly
2024110612493	overnight. She delivered a taste of that 2008 Obama feeling-hope. An endless amount of hope. I matched my wife and daughter on energy and bought in. When Obama was elected, I was naive about political power. I believed that his election would erase racism and force oppressors to see the errors of their ways. I foolishly thought his acceptance meant we were all being accepted, but that could not have been farther from the truth. The country accepted him, but not us. He was special. We were exactly the same. He experienced a revolution in his own home, life and legacy that we celebrate from the same places of uncertainty where we remain. That's the feeling I walked away with as a man. I can only imagine how Black women, who have to deal with double oppression, felt. I can only imagine how Black women, who have to deal with double oppression, felt. I was equally naive after Trump's first term, thinking his presidency would cause our country to collapse. Even though his mismanagement of COVID and hateful, divisive rhetoric left us eternally scarred, we are still here. We made it. Hopefully, my wife and I can show our daughter that she will make it to. Eight years of President Obama and four years of Trump have taught me that the goals I expected from my leader had to be realistic, not some dreamy left-wing utopia full of reparations, and universal freedom or instant destruction, as a result of chaotic racism. No leader will ever be too bad or too good. The only thing guaranteed is that we have to show up and fight. We will rally, we will vote and we will continue to champion women as a family. I don't want to lose this special moment by becoming lost in the reality of surviving Trump. Kamala Harris was elected Vice President. That is proof we are moving in the right direction, even as we prepare to navigate this setback. Her journey and leadership will continue to inspire my family as we prepare for whatever is next. And until we figure out what that is, we will be fighting - for you, for us and for America. Read more about 2024 elections D. Watkins is an Editor at Large for Salon.

2024110613171	Vice President Kamala Harris addressed the nation Wednesday to officially concede the 2024 presidential election to Donald Trump. Harris delivered a speech to the country and her supporters at Howard University in Washington D.C., her alma mater. Watch News4 now: Stream NBC4 newscasts for free right here, right now. 'While I concede this election,' Harris said, 'I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign.' 'I will never give up a fight for a future where Americans can pursue their dreams ambitions and aspirations,' she said. America, she added, 'will never give up the fight for our democracy.' Harris confirmed she called Trump to congratulate him on his election win, discussing the importance of a peaceful transfer of power with the president-elect. Biden has also called Trump to congratulate him and to invite him to the White House to discuss the transition. Biden plans to address the nation Thursday on the election results, the White House said. Howard had served as her election night headquarters where Harris had hoped to deliver a victory speech Tuesday night. But as midnight approached on the East Coast and election results trickled in showing victories for Donald Trump, the cheers in the crowd became silent and the Harris campaign turned off its projected broadcasts of CNN. Instead, the DJ blared music from speakers to hype the crowd. 'We still have votes to count. We still have states that have not been called yet. We will continue overnight to try to make sure that every vote is counted, that every voice has spoken,' campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond said. 'So you won't hear from the vice president tonight. But you will hear from her tomorrow, because she will be back here tomorrow to address not only the HU family, not only to address her supporters, but to address the nation.' Harris' surest way to 270 electoral votes was through Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, states Trump won in 2016 and President Joe Biden captured narrowly in 2020. But in state after state, including North Carolina and Georgia, Trump outperformed what he did in the 2020 election while Harris failed to do as well as Biden did in winning the presidency four years ago. Trump's win against Harris, the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket, marks the second time he has defeated a female rival in a general election. Harris rose to the top of the ticket after Biden exited the race with less than 100 days until Election day after a disastrous debate with the Republican nominee raised questions about his age and ability. Despite an initial surge of energy and excitement around her campaign, she struggled during a compressed timeline to convince disillusioned voters that she represented a break from an unpopular administration. Harris focused particularly on reproductive rights, an issue that drew women to her candidacy after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade decision and states began implementing restrictions on abortions. And while abortion rights measures won in seven states, it wasn't enough get Harris the win. Trump, meanwhile, sought to court male voters with a hypermasculine approach. At the ballot box, Trump trounced Harris among men while about half of women backed Harris. Trump ultimately won over voters with grand promises to improve the economy, block the flow of immigrants on the Southern border and his siren call to 'make America great again.' Overall, about half of Trump voters said inflation was the biggest issue factoring into their election decisions, according to evidence from the NBC News Exit Poll.
2024110613172	Nearly half - 45% - of all voters said they were worse off financially than they were four years ago. That was a higher level of dissatisfaction than what registered in exit polls in any recent election going back to 2008, when the election took place amid the financial crisis that propelled Barack Obama to victory. And though the economy is growing, with a low jobless rate and a booming stock market, 2 in 3 voters rated the U.S. economy poorly, a level higher than in 2020, when the country struggled to get in gear during the Covid pandemic. Harris and Trump ran very different campaigns, with Harris promising to work with people who disagreed with her, while Trump warned about 'the enemy within.' Besides abortion rights, she emphasized preserving democratic norms and tackling housing costs and other bread-and-butter economic issues. Harris refused to be drawn into spats with Trump, when for example he questioned whether she had downplayed her identity as a Black woman. Harris' mother came to the United States from India while her father is from Jamaica. Trump characterized Harris as a socialist, though she has a more centrist record, and insulted her intelligence and her qualifications. Harris was San Francisco's district attorney and California's attorney general before becoming a U.S. senator. Biden tapped her as his running mate after she ended her own campaign for president in 2020. But as part of the Biden administration, Harris struggled with other issues - the war in Gaza was the main one - over which she alienated many traditional Democratic voters. By contrast, Trump presented a dark vision of America, and one that fact checkers found filled with exaggerations and inaccuracies. He called migrants 'vermin' and charged they were committing violent crimes, made wild accusations about schools helping transgender schools transition without their parents' consent, and repeated his false claims that he, not Biden, had won the 2020 presidential election. Late in the campaign, a comedian at his Madison Square Garden rally insulted Puerto Ricans with a 'floating island of garbage' punchline. Trump has been found guilty of illegally influencing the 2016 election by making hush payments to a porn actress. He faces federal charges over his efforts to remain in the White House after the 2020 election and state charges in Georgia. The Associated Press contributed to this story.

Vice President Kamala Harris delivered her concession speech at Howard University, following her loss to Republican opponent Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Oh, yes, like bye bye. Ok, sorry friends then get back to bed. Yes. Oh bye. We are. Yeah. And when I wake up, I reckon she let me for the pay cut. We make a living skim it. So my, ok, that when I was looking at the world like where do we go? And we hate po po when they kill us. Dared in the street was so I'm at the pre door, my knees. Oh, what do you want to a house? Yeah, you can live with the number one I, I don't think to the public and this I assured my even up and down when I was looking at the world like where do we go? And we hate pork, pork when they kill us. So I'm at the peak. Just go. My knee is getting weak in my curve. Be all hours later and I have some of my prayers don the MA S MA to go. But you know you, I like it. Shut up. You know you make me go. No 1000. I still read how you out this house. So I PJ. Oh I'm fire shall be no competition. No, no. One our president for president of Blank greed and my why? Thanks. Tell me I just, yeah, please welcome the vice president of the United States. No, the good afternoon, the... good afternoon, everyone. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So let me say and I love you back and I love you back. So let me say my heart is full today. My heart is full today, full of gratitude for the trust you have placed in me, full of love for our country and full of resolve. The outcome of this election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for. But hear me when I say, hear me, when I say the light of America's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up. And as long as we keep fighting to my beloved Doug and our family, I love you so very much to President Biden and Dr Biden. Thank you for your faith and support to governor, walls and the walls, family. I know your service to our nation will continue and to my extraordinary team to the volunteers who gave so much of themselves to the poll workers and the local election officials. I thank you. I thank you all. Look, I am so proud of the race we ran and the way we ran it and the way we ran it over the 107 days of this campaign. We have been intentional about building community and building coalitions, bringing people together from every walk of life and background, united by love of country with enthusiasm and joy in our fight for America's future. And we did it with the knowledge that we all have so much more in common than what separates us. Now. I know folks are feeling and experiencing a range of emotions right now. I get it, but we must accept the results of this election. Earlier today, I spoke with President elect Trump and congratulated him on his victory. I also told him that we will help him and his team with their transition and that we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power. A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results. That principle as much as any other, distinguishes democracy from monarchy or tyranny. And anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it. At the same time in our nation. We owe loyalty not to a president or a party, but to the constitution of the United States and loyalty to our conscience and to our
2024110620582	God. My allegiance to all three is why I am here to say while I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign, the fight, the fight for freedom, for opportunity, for fairness and the dignity of all people. A fight for the ideals at the heart of our nation, the ideals that reflect America at our best. That is a fight. I will never give up. I will never give up the fight for a future where Americans can pursue their dreams, ambitions and aspirations. Where the women of America have the freedom to make decisions about their own bodies and not have their government telling them what to do. We will never give up the fight to protect our schools and our streets from gun violence and America. We will never give up the fight for our democracy, for the rule of law, for equal justice and for the sacred idea that every one of us no matter who we are or where we start out has certain fundamental rights and freedoms that must be respected and upheld. And we will continue to wage this fight in the voting booth in the courts and in the public square. And we will also wage it in quieter ways in how we live our lives, by treating one another with kindness and respect by looking in the face of a stranger and seeing a neighbor by always using our strength to lift people up to fight for the dignity that all people deserve. The fight for our freedom will take hard work. But like I always say, we like hard work, hard work is good work, hard work can be joyful work and the fight for our country is always worth it. It is always worth it. To the young people who are watching it is to the young people who are watching it is ok to feel sad and disappointed. But please know it's going to be ok on the campaign. I would often say when we fight, we win. But here's the thing, here's the thing. Sometimes the fight takes a while. That doesn't mean we won't win. That doesn't mean we won't win. The important thing is, don't ever give up, don't ever give up. Don't ever stop trying to make the world a better place. You have power, you have power. And don't you ever listen, when anyone tells you something is impossible because it has never been done before. You have the capacity to do extraordinary good in the world. And so to everyone who is watching, do not despair. This is not a time to throw up our hands. This is a time to roll up our sleeves. This is a time to organize, to mobilize and to stay engaged for the sake of freedom and justice and the future that we all know we can build together. Look many of, you know, I started out as a prosecutor and throughout my career, I saw people at some of the worst times in their lives. People who had suffered great harm and great pain and yet found within themselves, the strength and the courage and the resolve to take the stand to take a stand to fight for justice to fight for themselves, to fight for others. So let their courage be our inspiration, let their determination be our charge. And I'll close with this. There's an adage, an historian once called a Law of History. True of every society across the ages. The adage is only when it is dark enough. Can you see the stars? I know many people feel like we are entering a dark time, but for the benefit of us all, I hope that is not the case. But here's the thing America. If it is, let us fill the sky with the light of a brilliant, brilliant billion of stars, the light, the light of optimism, of faith, of truth and service... hu and may that work guide us even in the face of setbacks toward the extraordinary promise of the United States of America.

2024110619141	By Gene Maddaus Senior Media Writer Kamala Harris called Donald Trump on Wednesday to concede the presidential race, and to urge him to be a president for 'all Americans,' according to a campaign memo. Harris is expected to give a concession speech later on Wednesday at Howard University. In the memo, campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said that Harris also pledged to work with President Biden to ensure a peaceful transition to power - a pointed allusion to the violent transfer in 2020. A Trump campaign spokesman confirmed that Harris had called to congratulate him on his 'historic victory.' 'President Trump acknowledged Vice President Harris on her strength, professionalism, and tenacity throughout the campaign, and both leaders agreed on the importance of unifying the country,' said the spokesman, Steven Cheung. O'Malley Dillon thanked her campaign staff for building a 'first-rate, historic Presidential campaign in basically 90 days.' 'You stared down unprecedented headwinds and obstacles that were largely out of our control,' she wrote. 'We knew this would be a margin of error race, and it was.' She also noted that the rightward swing to Trump was less pronounced in the contested states, arguing that showed the campaign had an impact in countering the national mood. 'That speaks to both the work you did, and the scale of the challenge we ultimately couldn't surmount,' she wrote. O'Malley Dillon also said that losing the race was 'unfathomably painful.' 'It is hard,' she wrote. 'This will take a long time to process. But the work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump Presidency starts now.' Trump is poised to sweep all seven battleground states, though the race has not been called yet in Arizona and Nevada. The Republicans also took control of the U.S. Senate. 2 Comments Comments are moderated. They may be edited for clarity and reprinting in whole or in part in Variety publications.

2024110621501	Vice President Kamala Harris publicly conceded the 2024 election to former President Donald Trump in a Wednesday afternoon speech at her alma mater, Howard University. Harris walked out to her campaign theme song, 'Freedom,' by Beyonce, to applause and chants of 'Kamala.' 'My heart is full today,' she told the tearful crowd. 'Full of gratitude for the trust you have placed in me. Full of love for our country. And full of resolve. The outcome of this election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for.' 'But hear me when I say, the light of America's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting,' she added. Harris said she was proud of her campaign, which lasted only 107 days. She told the crowd that she had already pledged to assist Trump with the transition and ensure a peaceful transfer of power. 'In our nation, we owe loyalty not to a president or a party but to the Constitution of the United States,' Harris said. 'And loyalty to our conscience and to our God. My allegiance to all three is why I am here to say, while I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign.' In her speech, Harris hit on several touchstones of her campaign, including abortion protection, gun safety, democracy, and equal justice, promising to continue fighting. 'Fighting for our country is always worth it,' she said. The vice president addressed young people specifically, promising them that it would be 'OK' and encouraging them to continue working. 'Sometimes the fight takes a while, but that doesn't mean we won't win,' Harris said, referencing her campaign slogan. Harris thanked her husband, Doug Emhoff, President Joe Biden, her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, her campaign staff, and poll workers. Harris campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon sent staff members a memo ahead of the vice president's remarks on Wednesday, confirming that Harris had conceded the race to Trump and pledged to ensure a peaceful transfer of power from the Biden administration. O'Malley Dillon praised campaign staffers and congratulated them on a 'first-rate, historic Presidential campaign,' according to the memo obtained by Business Insider. 'You navigated things that no one has ever had to navigate, and likely no one will ever have to again,' she wrote. Harris became the Democratic nominee in August after President Joe Biden stepped down following a disastrous debate performance. She campaigned for just over three months before voters went to the polls this week. 'You stared down unprecedented headwinds and obstacles that were largely out of our control,' the memo continued. 'We knew this would be a margin of error race, and it was.' Nearly every state in the country moved further right in Tuesday's election, but O'Malley Dillon said the battleground states saw the least amount of movement compared to the rest of the nation. 'It was closest in the places we competed,' she wrote. 'That speaks to both the work you did and the scale of the challenge we ultimately couldn't surmount.' Harris' concession comes hours after Trump cinched a spectacular victory, winning several swing states and a swath of new voters since his last campaign. In his victory speech early Wednesday morning, Trump claimed a 'mandate' for his agenda and pledged to put 'divisions' in the past. Immediately following her speech, Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, were set to host an all-staff call to detail the campaign's accomplishment and discuss the 'road ahead,' according to the memo.

2024110619531	Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday called President-elect Donald Trump to concede the 2024 presidential race, and a representative for Trump said the two 'agreed on the importance of unifying the country.' Trump was declared the winner of the presidency by The Associated Press (AP) early Wednesday morning when he pushed over the required threshold of 270 Electoral College votes. So far, he beat Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, in the swing states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia and North Carolina and 22 Republican-leaning states. He also secured four of the five electoral votes in Nebraska and one in Maine, bringing his total to 292 Electoral College votes. 'President Donald J. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris spoke by phone earlier today where she congratulated him on his historic victory,' Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement. 'President Trump acknowledged Vice President Harris on her strength, professionalism, and tenacity throughout the campaign, and both leaders agreed on the importance of unifying the country.' According to an email sent to her campaign staff, Harris called Trump on Wednesday. 'Just a few moments ago, the Vice President connected with President Trump to concede the race,' the email from campaign chief Jen O'Malley Dillon said. Dillion said losing was 'unfathomably painful' and will 'take a long time to process,' but that Harris said she would work with President Joe Biden 'to ensure a peaceful transfer of power, unlike what we saw in 2020.' 'It is hard. This will take a long time to process,' the email added. 'But the work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump Presidency starts now.' Meanwhile, Trump gave a victory speech early Wednesday morning at the Palm Beach Convention Center in Florida, hours before the AP declared him the winner. 'We overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible and it is now clear that we've achieved the most incredible political thing, look what happened, is this crazy? But it's a political victory that our country has never seen before, nothing like this,' he said. 'I want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honor of being elected your 47th president and your 45th president.' Trump said his second term will be 'the golden age of America' and vowed to fight for every American's future. 'And every citizen, I will fight for you, for your family and your future, every single day I will be fighting for you with every breath in my body, I will not rest until we have delivered the strong, safe and prosperous America that our children deserve and that you deserve, he said.

2024110623171	Kamala Harris conceded to Donald Trump in the presidential race on Wednesday, both in a private phone call and in a public speech at Howard University. She spoke for about 12 minutes, offering the usual elements of a concession speech - praising her family, her campaign and her supporters - and acknowledging her loss. It was both gracious and, as Anderson Cooper said on CNN, 'defiant in many ways.' It also included eight words more important than any others, and ones that didn't get enough attention after she was done: 'We must accept the results of this election.' Plain, simple, obvious. And yet in the current landscape, sadly essential. Because let's face it, in normal times she wouldn't even need to say this. It's a given. These are not, of course, normal times. Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle. Harris went on to say that the administration will engage in a peaceful transfer of power. 'A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election,' she said, 'we must accept the results.' Someone remind Donald Trump. And Fox News, while you're at it. While that network's panel whined about Harris not having Joe Biden around, or something (it was hard to tell what the exact complaint was) and Brit Hume dustily scoffed that her speech was 'not particularly memorable,' they conveniently ignored the obvious: Trump never conceded the 2020 election, and continues to lie about its results. The hypocrisy is galling, the disdain for the audience's memory and awareness breathtaking. Yes, Trump won back the presidency, but the damage to the institution is done. Say so. CNN's Kaitlan Collins got it. 'Hearing her emphasize that line about a peaceful transition of power, it makes you realize she is affording to Trump what he never afforded to the incoming Biden-Harris administration,' she said. Quite the opposite, in fact. Trump egging on supporters to attack the U.S. Capitol to interrupt the certification of the 2020 election is still unthinkable, an affront to democracy. Yet somehow it's become almost a footnote to an administration that had disdain for the institutions of power. And, of course, Trump didn't stick around for Biden's inauguration, leaving town that morning. For what it's worth, Biden called Trump on Wednesday to congratulate him on his win and invited him to the White House, and has said he will be at the inauguration. Trump has called Biden 'Sleepy Joe' and called Harris worse, but some things you do because you're supposed to do them. Have we forgotten all this? Is this where we've landed? In a place where conducting yourself with the bare minimum of civility and decent behavior is notable, almost remarkable? Evidently. The last four years, for all of the bizarre drama of the last five months of the election season, were a return to normalcy in terms of the presidency. Normal isn't boring, it's just normal. Sure, setting a car on fire attracts the fire department and the TV news crews. But it's not an effective way to get to work. Now that Trump is returning to power, is there any reason to believe that his next administration will be any less chaotic than the first? Not if his campaign, with its racist, misogynistic trappings, is any indication. Trump will make news. He'll make sure of that. Maybe that's why Harris' speech, while fiery in its own way, felt like a throwback, a last gasp of normalcy. Enjoy it while it lasts. Opinion:TV news is awash in election post-mortems.

2024110621041	By Patrick Hipes Executive Managing Editor Vice President Kamala Harris will give her concession speech after losing the 2024 presidential election overnight, when Donald Trump officially clinched a second term by going over the 270 electoral votes needed for victory. She is expected to address supporters at Howard University at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET today, with coverage expected across broadcast and cable news networks after a long night of following returns. Howard, her Washington, D.C.-based alma mater, is where her supporters had been gathered Tuesday with the hopes of celebrating her victory. That didn't happen, with Trump outperforming his 2016 vote results especially in key battleground states, taking Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and North Carolina before sealing the victory when Wisconsin was called for him overnight. Watch Harris' speech above (It starts at the 24'30' mark.) In her call with Trump today, Harris formally conceded, according to media reports and the Trump campaign. Said Trump campaign communications director Steven Cheung:, 'President Donald J. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris spoke by phone earlier today where she congratulated him on his historic victory. President Trump acknowledged Vice President Harris on her strength, professionalism, and tenacity throughout the campaign, and both leaders agreed on the importance of unifying the country.' President Joe Biden followed with a similar call, inviting Trump to the White House. Biden is expected to address the country on Thursday. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

2024110710031	News Analysis Kamala Harris's resounding defeat affirmed the worst of what many Black women believed about their country, even as some looked to the future with a wary determination. News Analysis Kamala Harris's resounding defeat affirmed the worst of what many Black women believed about their country, even as some looked to the future with a wary determination. Vice President Kamala Harris held her election-night party at Howard University, the historically Black institution in Washington she once attended. The mood quickly grew bleak as results arrived.Credit...Maansi Srivastava for The New York Times Supported by By Erica L. Green and Maya King Erica L. Green reported from Kamala Harris's concession speech at Howard University in Washington, and Maya King from Atlanta. From the moment Kamala Harris entered the presidential race, Black women could see the mountaintop. Across the country, they led an outpouring of Democratic elation when the vice president took over the top of the presidential ticket. But underneath their hope and determination was a persistent worry: Was America ready, they asked, to elect a Black woman? The painful answer arrived this week. It affirmed the worst of what many Black women believed about their country: that it would rather choose a man who was convicted of 34 felonies, has spewed lies and falsehoods, disparaged women and people of color, and pledged to use the powers of the federal government to punish his political opponents than send a woman of color to the White House. Many Democrats saw the brutal political environment for the party, peppered with anger about President Biden's leadership, as more to blame for Ms. Harris's crushing loss than the double-edged sword of racism and sexism. But others, reflecting on a campaign devoid of controversy or obvious missteps by a qualified candidate who almost never held out her race or gender as reasons to vote for her, found it difficult to ignore suspicions about why Mr. Trump won with such ease. 'This isn't a loss for Black women, it's a loss for the country,' said Waikinya Clanton, the founder of the organizing group Black Women for Kamala. 'America has revealed to us her true self,' she added, 'and we have to decide what we do with her from here.' It was the moment that Black female political leaders and organizers had feared most and worked hardest to avoid. Across battleground states, the Democrats organizing fund-raisers, door-knocking and other get-out-the-vote efforts were often Black women, motivated to campaign for a presidential candidate who was not just a member of their party but one of their own. The tens of millions of voters who supported Ms. Harris saw her candidacy as a chance to usher in a new generation of leadership. (In one small bright spot for the party, two Black women will be in the next Senate for the first time ever.) But for Black women, the Democratic Party's most active and loyal voting bloc, it was something bigger: a hard-fought recognition of the work they had done for a party that often failed to support them. 'The party has always wanted our output, not necessarily our input,' Marcia Fudge, a former housing and urban development secretary under Mr. Biden, said in an interview this year. 'We have for a very long time been the people who did the work, but never been asked to sit at the table.' From the start of her first presidential campaign, Ms. Harris's supporters saw her as the redemption for their party and vindication for the Black women who had come before her. During her 2019 bid, she modeled much of her
2024110710032	political persona after Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman elected to Congress, in 1968, and the first Black woman to run for a major party's presidential nomination, in 1972. Many of Ms. Chisholm's acolytes became Ms. Harris's advisers and closest confidants during her second presidential campaign. But even Ms. Chisholm predicted a slow walk to progress. That was, in part, because of the intense sexism that she faced from men of all races, who believed that her campaign was too tailored to issues favoring women, people of color and the poor. 'This 'woman thing' is so deep,' she said of her presidential run. 'I've found it out in this campaign, if I never knew it before.' 'That I am a national figure because I was the first person in 192 years to be at once a congressman, Black and a woman proves, I would think, that our society is not yet either just or free,' she wrote in her autobiography, 'Unbought and Unbossed.' Maya Wiley, the chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said there was deep anger about the license that Mr. Trump's victory had given to continue to undercut Black women in politics, down to the derogatory ways he and his allies have described female leaders. Presidential Election Results Map: See how Donald Trump won. Red Shift Across the U.S.: Of the counties with nearly complete results, more than 90 percent shifted in favor of Trump. 10 Takeaways From Trump's Win: America's democracy will again be put to the test. Republicans Clinch Control of the Senate: Tight races in swing states will determine their margin. 'Not only have we always been on the menu, but they have been eating us, and it's been happening for generations,' Ms. Wiley said. 'And what this represents for Black women right now is it has deepened and been given significantly more permission.' Still, she added, 'it is not over, because we never go away.' Mr. Trump's overwhelming victory leaves Democrats with a lot of work to do. Nearly the entire country shifted sharply to the right as it returned him to power. Democrats watched as he won alarmingly high shares of the vote in blue states: 47 percent in Virginia and New Jersey. 44 percent in New York. 43 percent in Connecticut. The night represented a striking rebuke of a Democratic Party that has grown more aligned with college-educated, wealthier Americans, and struggled to maintain support from working-class voters and people of color. As the party picks up the pieces, preparing to oppose a second Trump administration and looking ahead to 2026 and 2028, Black women are likely to again play a central role. Long hailed as the backbone of the Democratic Party, they have supported liberal candidates in overwhelming numbers, organized political operations on the ground and fueled victory after victory. Yet Black women running for office have often said that the party is not investing adequately in their campaigns, particularly those for higher positions like Senate and governor (there has still never been a Black female governor). Some candidates have argued that this dearth in support has been the difference between winning and losing in close races. Ms. Harris had plenty of investment, hauling in more than $1 billion, but the circumstances of her candidacy were far from ideal. Overnight, she had to resuscitate a dying campaign and re-energize a despairing Democratic base that had fallen into despondency over Mr. Biden's poor debate performance and sinking political standing. She stayed fiercely loyal to a boss who had grown widely disliked, and who at times privately
2024110710033	doubted her chances. She stayed a cheerleader for the administration even though some of its leaders spent the first half of her term undermining her to the point of rendering her invisible and ineffective. And she fired up a party whose leaders had only in July talked quietly about bypassing her to put a white man at the top of the ticket. Ms. Harris worked feverishly to introduce herself and sell her political vision to an angry and exhausted American public - even as she struggled to separate herself from Mr. Biden. She built a multiracial, bipartisan coalition of supporters and allies. And it wasn't enough. 'She ran a damn good race, and we voted for white nationalism,' said Melanie L. Campbell, the chair of the Power of the Ballot Action Fund, an advocacy group focused on policies for Black Americans, who served on a committee of women who advised Mr. Biden in choosing Ms. Harris as his running mate. 'This level of vote was not because they were worried about grocery prices,' she said of American voters. 'They were worried about white privilege, white status, and sent the message that a multiracial democracy is fine as long as they're at the top.' As Ms. Harris conceded, she tacitly acknowledged the challenge she had faced. 'Don't you ever listen when anyone tells you something is impossible because it has never been done before,' she said. There were some signs on Tuesday of political momentum for Black women down the ballot. Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware and Angela Alsobrooks, the Prince George's County executive in Maryland, both won their races for Senate, giving the chamber two Black women for the first time - a long-sought goal for Black Democrats. But for Black women in the party, the defeat of Ms. Harris will sting for a long time. 'The vice president said from the very beginning that she was going to be running this race as an underdog, when you have 107 days versus somebody who's been running for nine years,' Senator Laphonza Butler of California, a close adviser to Ms. Harris, said on Tuesday night as the vice president's prospects dimmed. Citing the hundreds of Black women who were running in races across the country, Ms. Butler said that even if Ms. Harris lost, she would have proved to the Democratic Party and to the country that not only were Black women the beating heart of the party, 'but we are ready to take our seat at the table.' 'The country better be ready for the future of Black women who are going to continue to show up and demand their seat,' she said. Erica L.

2024110707211	New Times, New Thinking. Will the Democratic elite learn anything from her defeat? By Freddie Hayward Kamala Harris's favourite spot when she studied at Howard University in the 1980s was a large, grass-covered area in the middle of campus called the Yard. She would stand there and watch the musicians playing instruments and the medics leaving the lab, the students laughing together. 'That was the beauty of Howard,' she wrote in her memoir. 'Every signal told students that we could be anything - we were young, gifted, and black - and we shouldn't let anything get in the way of our success.' Forty years later, the Yard was where Harris hoped to declare her ascension to the American presidency. But it was not to be. There, yesterday afternoon (6 November), in front of a small crowd of supporters, staffers and Howard students, she conceded defeat. Her uplifting tone was unbowed. She delivered a message of defiant hope. 'My heart is full today - full of gratitude for the trust you have placed in me, full of love for our country and full of resolve,' she said. She sought to inspire her supporters to continue the fight against the type of politics which Trump represents, a politics she left undefined. 'While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fuelled this campaign - the fight for freedom,' she said. 'Don't ever stop trying to make the world a better place. You have power. You have power.' It was surreal. Her positivity created the impression that Harris hadn't really lost, that the entire reason for everyone being there was not now redundant, that the Republicans hadn't (almost certainly) won the popular vote for the first time since 2004. She had no contrition for the loss, nor did she try to wrestle with the reasons behind her defeat. The message was the opposite: keep calm and carry on, stay the course, keep going. She spoke as if nothing had gone wrong and the strategy had delivered. Her finale was characteristic of her campaign: 'I know many people feel like we are entering a dark time, but for the benefit of us all, I hope that is not the case. But America, if it is, let us fill the sky with the light of a brilliant, brilliant billion of stars.' It was at this point that people around me started giggling. Minutes before Harris mounted the stage, a statement from Senator Bernie Sanders began pinging on to attendees' phones. It was a stinging rebuke of everything she was about to say. It read: 'It should come as no surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them. While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change. And they're right,' he said. 'Will the big money interests and well-paid consultants who control the Democratic Party learn any real lessons from this disastrous campaign?. Probably not.' This was a furious indictment of the Democratic Party. It echoed David Axelrod's comment on CNN that the party treated the working class like 'natives' who needed to be civilised. Despite his opposition to the administration's supplying of weapons to Israel, Sanders endorsed Harris. But his statement yesterday marked the first shot in the fight over why the party lost, the conclusion of which will dictate its direction over the next four years. Dissenters are already criticising Harris for cosying up to Republicans like Liz Cheney, for diluting Joe Biden's economic populism and for relying on shallow and incoherent messaging. Expect a reckoning on Gaza, while some quiet voices are raising
2024110707212	concerns about the party's failure to stop illegal migrant crossings. On the opposite side, Harris's staffers are already briefing that the blame should fall on Biden's refusal to stand down in good time. But the Democrats are in trouble if the focus remains on the timing of Biden's exit. If Harris had more time, would she have won? Isn't there a risk that the more the public got to know her, the worse the result would have been? Her concession speech was a sign that the party elite will plough on as before, unreflective about the distance between themselves and large swathes of the electorate. After the crowds started streaming out of the gates back towards the centre of Washington, one man cheerily remarked to a friend, 'You know, I remember that Hillary also gave an awesome concession speech in 2016.'

2024110611271	Analysts say race and gender played a significant role in Harris's defeat, but so did voter disillusionment. Vice President Kamala Harris's loss in the US presidential election means that she has become the second female candidate to be beaten by Republican Donald Trump, despite mounting a historic campaign. For the analysts who spoke to Al Jazeera, Harris's loss brought a sense of deja vu, echoing the defeat of fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. They stressed that Harris's race and gender played a pivotal role in her defeat at the hands of former President Trump, whose political career has been defined by sexism and racism. 'The biggest underlying dynamic in American politics right now is views toward race, views toward gender,' said Tresa Undem, a public opinion researcher focused on gender. Undem and other experts predict the Democrats will face a tsunami of backlash, given the stakes of the 2024 election. 'Harris and the Democrats are going to face a whole lot of wrath,' Undem explained. 'There will be all kinds of narratives: What's wrong with Democrats? What's wrong with Harris? Was it her race and gender? She talks about abortion too much.' As the shock of Harris's loss settles, Mike Nellis, a former adviser to Harris's 2020 campaign and a founder of the group White Dudes for Harris, said there will be crucial lessons for the Democratic Party to heed as it faces the battles ahead under President-elect Trump. 'Everybody will have an opinion,' Nellis told Al Jazeera. 'All of our hair will be on fire.' Had she won, Harris would have shattered glass ceilings and become the first woman, second Black person and first South Asian to be elected to the highest office in the land. Harris herself made little mention of the historic nature of her presidential bid during her compressed, three-month sprint to Election Day, after President Joe Biden dropped out in July. Instead, she pitched herself as a candidate for 'all Americans', running a centrist campaign and promising a continuation of Biden's policies. Part of that strategy included overtures to Republicans disillusioned with Trump, and she campaigned alongside conservative lawmakers like former US Representative Liz Cheney. But it wasn't enough to win her the White House. 'This loss indicates we still have so much more work to do here in the US in terms of sex and race relations,' said Tammy Vigil, a professor at Boston University whose research focuses on women in politics. Vigil said that Trump has 'afforded people the ability to be their worst selves, and that definitely includes being sexist and racist'. The question of gender and race will continue to be a mobilising force, she added: 'It's going to be a big rallying cry.' For Nadia Brown, the director of the women's and gender studies programme at Georgetown University, there is no question that Harris was the better-qualified candidate in the race. She had decades of government experience under her belt: from her time as a public prosecutor to her service in the Senate and White House. That raises questions about why so many voters opted for her opponent, Brown explained. 'This loss just underscores the amount of ingrained racism and white hetero-patriarchy, the deep-seatedness of white supremacy in this nation,' Brown said. 'You can't deny that she is someone who could have served as president on day one.' Trump has repeatedly described Harris as 'low IQ' and 'mentally disabled', even calling her 'one of the dumber people in the history of our country'. That kind of rhetoric, Brown said, gave his supporters a licence
2024110611272	to dismiss and denigrate Harris. 'The way that Trump has painted her and people's responses to her have just brought out the worst in a lot of folks.' Andra Gillespie, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta, noted that Harris is not the first presidential candidate to encounter hurdles based on race or gender. She pointed to former President Barack Obama, the first Black president of the US, who faced repeated questions about his country of birth and whether he was Muslim. And then there was Clinton, the first female presidential nominee from a major party. During her campaign, Trump supporters rallied under signs that read, 'Trump that b****'. Trump himself accused her of 'playing the woman's card'. While Obama faced challenges with race and Clinton with gender, those hurdles were compounded for Harris, Gillespie told Al Jazeera, adding that the 'sexism that Harris faced is racially tinged'. 'All three of them, because of the ways that they were different, experienced challenges,' Gillespie said of Harris, Clinton and Obama. But Gillespie argued it was 'doubly hard for Harris' because of the combined force of misogyny and racism. 'Harris experienced them differently because she is both a woman and a person of colour.' But Harris's loss does not solely come down to questions of race and gender. Several analysts said the Democratic Party will have to grapple with how effectively it was able to connect with key demographics during this presidential race, including those disenchanted by Harris's stance on Israel's war in Gaza. The war had splintered the party in the lead-up to the election, with progressives, Arab Americans and Muslim voters largely opposing the Biden-Harris administration's continued support of Israel. Dalia Mogahed, a former research director at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, had warned that Harris's pro-Israel stance had the potential of costing her the election. But she emphasised it would be unfair to blame specific demographics for Harris's loss. 'It's the candidate that should be earning people's votes, not feeling entitled to them,' Mogahed said. Still, she feared that the tendency to assign blame may crop up now that Harris has been defeated. When Trump was first elected in 2016, there was a lot of 'liberal sympathy' for Muslim and Arab people who were seen as victims of his policies, Mogahed said. Trump implemented what critics called a 'Muslim ban' in 2017, restricting entry from seven Muslim-majority countries. But given the large Arab American and Muslim backlash to Harris's support for Israel, that same sympathy might not be present this time around, Mogahed warned. 'Muslims might feel very isolated in a second Trump presidency,' she said. 'And it's going to be a very difficult four years for anyone who is advocating on behalf of the humanity of Palestinians.' For Rasha Mubarak, a Palestinian American community organiser from Florida, Harris's defeat highlights the Democratic Party's failures to connect with key elements of its base. 'The Democratic Party continues to fail in listening to their voters,' Mubarak said, citing the party's support for Israel as well as its lack of engagement with under-resourced communities. She pointed out that, while Trump also boasts pro-Israel policies, Democrats like Harris had an opportunity to take action to alleviate the humanitarian concerns raised by Israel's war. But they did not. 'They had the power to place an arms embargo but instead chose to continue to fund and endorse Israel's genocide, and now it is the people in this country
2024110611273	that will continue to suffer,' Mubarak explained. 'But the people have spoken, and this is a message that they will no longer continue to vote for a cleaner dirty shirt.' Nellis, the former Harris adviser, stressed that, to be successful in future presidential races, Democrats must ask themselves, 'What are the things about us that we can change?' The condensed nature of Harris's campaign did not help, Nellis said, but Democrats need to think about the voters they left behind. That includes demographics commonly associated with the Republican Party. 'I want to have a serious conversation about how we're talking to and trying to bring back non-college-educated white men. I want to talk about rural voters. I want to talk about going into hostile spaces and trying to win folks back,' he said. Most urgently, he added, 'We need to be mobilising to fight back and try to stop some of the worst things that Trump is going to want to do.' With Harris defeated, Brown, the Georgetown University professor, predicts the US will not see the groundswell of protest that greeted Trump's first win in 2016. In 2017, the day after Trump was inaugurated, thousands of women flooded the streets in Washington, DC, and other cities with pink hats and feminist slogans. Activists around the country organised anti-Trump 'resistance' campaigns. Brown said that there may be some protests this year, though likely not to that scale. 'I've been doing focus groups with Black women who are the most reliable Democratic voters, and what they're sharing is that they are just exhausted. They are fatigued. They are burned out,' said Brown. Protesting Trump, she added, has become 'less safe'. More than 180 people, for example, were arrested for protesting Trump's inauguration, and some were charged with felony rioting - though many of those charges were later dropped. But Trump has promised vengeance against critics and opponents, and many fear that the repression of dissent will be far harsher this time around. 'There are going to be some people who will figure out ways to resist,' Gillespie at Emory University said. 'The big question is, how will Trump respond? Does he respond with repression?' Vigil of Boston University pointed to recent decisions by two leading national newspapers to cancel their Harris endorsements as evidence that even the powerful fear a Trump backlash. 'Unfortunately there is a fear that has become [almost] pervasive among business owners, among reporters, among everyday people,' Vigil said. Trump, she noted, has called his domestic adversaries 'the enemy within' - and threatened military intervention against them. 'All that speaks to the motion towards fascism that Harris was right about,' Vigil said. That, in turn, threatens to dampen any protest. 'People not only are tired and worn out and figure it doesn't matter any more, but if we don't see those kinds of rallies, I think there's going to be a fear element to it as well.'
