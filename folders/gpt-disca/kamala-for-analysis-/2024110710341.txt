Democratic figures have hit out against Vice President Kamala Harris, her choice of running mate, and how she ran her campaign following the vice president's crushing election defeat to Donald Trump. The nature of the presidential election loss, as well as the party losing control of the Senate and possibly the House to the GOP, has left some Democrats angry and questioning the future of the party. A number of Democratic lawmakers, operatives, and aides have now given their views on why Harris suffered such a heavy loss in the November 5 election. These range from her choosing Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as the vice presidential candidate, failing to distance herself enough from President Joe Biden, to the party abandoning working class voters. Others have laid the blame purely on Biden for not dropping out of the 2024 race sooner and for giving Harris the difficult job of winning over voters after he recorded at times historically low approval ratings. Biden's term in office saw high levels of inflation and a cost of living crisis, with voters frequently citing the economy as their number one election issue. Newsweek has contacted the White House and Harris' campaign team for comment via email. Independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 and 2020, blamed the party and its leadership for ignoring working class voters during the 'disastrous' campaign. 'It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them,' Sanders said in a statement. 'First it was the working class, and now it is Latino and Black voters as well. While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change. And they're right.' David Sirota, a senior adviser for Sanders' 2020 presidential campaign, expressed a similar sentiment about why Harris and the party had a 'very bad night' in the election. 'Some of us spent years warning Dems to take working-class politics more seriously and to not tout neocons,' Sirota posted on X, formerly Twitter. 'We did so in hopes of avoiding this, and yet we were vilified as traitors by Dem elites and liberal pundits. There's a lesson here.' Lindy Li, a political commentator and Democratic National Committee member, suggested that Harris made a mistake in picking Walz over Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro as her running mate. Shapiro was seen as one of the front-runners for the vice presidential candidate position to help Harris win the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania. Trump managed to flip the Keystone State, as well as the other key blue wall battleground states of Wisconsin and Michigan, which were crucial for Harris' hopes of election victory. 'I know a lot of people are probably wondering tonight what would have happened had Shapiro been on the ticket,' Li, who is also Pennsylvania commissioner, told Fox News. 'And not only in terms of Pennsylvania. He's famously a moderate. So that would have signaled to the American people that she is not the San Francisco liberal that Trump said she was.' 'In the eyes of the American people, [Walz] was the governor who oversaw the [George Floyd] protests in Minnesota and probably let it go on longer than he should have. So that has been seared in the minds of the American people,' she added. Li also said Harris made a mistake during her appearance on ABC's The View in October.
