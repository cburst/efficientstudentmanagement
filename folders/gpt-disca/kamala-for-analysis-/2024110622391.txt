It was supposed to be everything short of a free ad - a panel of women not containing their excitement to welcome Kamala Harris, ready to introduce her to their committed daytime audience of exactly the type of women the vice president's campaign always hoped were going to be critical to her base. It was a moment that encapsulated one of the biggest challenges facing her campaign - which, in the end, proved insurmountable. 'What, if anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?' co-host of ABC's 'The View' Sunny Hostin asked Harris, looking to give her a set for her to spike over the net. Related article Trump will win second term, CNN projects, in historic comeback after losing four years ago 'There is not a thing that comes to mind,' she said. Even Harris realized she had a problem, trying to adjust a moment later by saying she would put a Republican in her Cabinet. Aides didn't wait until Harris was off the set to start trying to clean it up. A Democrat who had spoken with her told CNN at the time that she didn't want to name her differences with President Joe Biden - including a higher capital gains tax rate, a bigger child tax credit and a tougher border policy - because she thought it would look disloyal to the man who had picked her as his running mate and then stepped aside for her. The thud fell in a campaign already struggling with a listless October, which had replaced the late summer exuberance and a September debate that nearly every political observer other than Donald Trump acknowledged she crushed. As aides new to the Harris orbit exerted control, she struggled with preparation. She grew hesitant, losing some of the confidence and swagger that had defined the early weeks of her reintroduction to the country. Aides who had successfully pushed her out of her comfort zone earlier in the year felt like they were running into the kind of walls she used to put up. CNN spoke with over a dozen senior Harris campaign aides both in the Wilmington, Delaware, campaign headquarters and on the ground in the states, as well as multiple volunteers and local elected officials, over the course of the final weeks of the race. A country crying out for change got a candidate who, at a crucial moment as more voters were tuning in, decided to soft-pedal the change she knew she represented. In the scope of a Democratic ticket that pulled off the biggest turnaround in approval ratings and the fastest consolidation around a new candidate in the history of modern presidential politics, this may have seemed like a minor moment. But it reflected deeper problems: some, like with the staff around her, that she might have been able to adjust; and one, with Biden, that she could never shake, with internal polls showing overwhelming majorities of voters thought the country was on the wrong track. By the time Harris got a clearer, sharper contrast answer out on the Biden question, the situation had congealed in ways she never got past - both among voters wavering in the center who wanted to hear her rebuff the president on his handling of the economy and voters on the left who wanted to hear her more forcefully disavow Biden's support for Israel. But perhaps the bigger problem with Biden, top Democrats fumed in the aftermath of that fateful debate in June and then again as they watched the results turn red on Tuesday, is that he should have never been anywhere near the 2024 race. If he had stepped aside after the midterms, as some aides urged him to, the Democratic Party process could have played
