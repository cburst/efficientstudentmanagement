rhetorical skills fundamental to her professional career. Harris also was selected as one of 38 spring 1986 initiates into the Alpha chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated, the oldest Black Greek letter organization for women. 'When you're at an HBCU, and especially one with the size and with the history of Howard University - and also in the context of also being in DC, which was known forever as being 'Chocolate City' - it just becomes about you understanding that there is a whole world of people who are like you,' Harris was quoted in a 2019 Washington Post article. 'It's not just about there are a few of us who may find each other.' Harris would also begin to leverage her access to the levers of power stationed in the nation's capital, joining her fellow Bison in anti-apartheid protests at the National Mall and the South African embassy. Ahead of her third year at Howard, Harris interned in the office of California Senator Alan Cranston, a seat to which she herself would ascend three decades later. During her Howard undergraduate career, Harris would also secure internships with the Federal Trade Commission and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. By Harris' college graduation in 1986, she was primed for a career in the legal field, undergirded by the classroom education and experiential learning opportunities provided to her by Howard University. Soon, she would be making history as an attorney in California, and as a civil servant for the nation. 'The thing that Howard taught me is that you can do any collection of things, and not one thing to the exclusion of the other,' Harris said. 'You could be homecoming queen and valedictorian. There are no false choices at Howard.' Harris' experience on the debate team at Howard no doubt prepared her for the next chapters in her journey. She earned a law degree from the University of California, Hastings College of Law. As a young prosecutor in Alameda County, Calif., she took on tough cases in Berkeley and Oakland in the height of the crack epidemic. She also dealt with child sexual assault. She defeated an incumbent to become the district attorney in San Francisco, the first Black person to do so in the state of California. True to her philosophy of not accepting false choices, Harris focused on aggressively prosecuting criminals but also creating paths to rehabilitation. She helped non-violent criminals get job training and worked to keep young offenders in school. 'In my career, the conventional wisdom was that people are either soft on crime or tough on crime, but I knew we should be smart on crime,' she told the audience at the Howard University's 149th Commencement. She waged a campaign for attorney general promising to be a pragmatic law enforcer, and instituted unprecedent policies to tackle issues. She tackled an alarming trend in truancy by implementing laws which held parents accountable and led to parental prosecutions. She defended the state death penalty law even though she was personally opposed to it. 'She is focused on the end result and the impact she can have on people's lives less than the process,' Brian Brokaw, who managed Harris' state attorney general campaigns, told the BBC. Harris had a full circle moment in 2016 when she was elected to the U.S. Senate to represent California, given that she interned for Senator Alan Cranston as a mailroom clerk as a Howard student. She inherited the seat from the legendary Barbara Boxer. In the Senate, she brought her prosecutorial style to Senate hearings, helping to hold administration officials accountable.
