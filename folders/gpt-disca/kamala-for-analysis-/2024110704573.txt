Her speech to the American people will end a historic, 100-day dash to become the 47th President of the U.S., which began after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July. A large crowd is waiting at the campaign staging area on Howard's campus. She is expected to speak shortly after 4 p.m. President Biden spoke with both Harris and Trump by phone Wednesday afternoon, the White House said. Biden congratulated the vice president on her historic campaign. In his call to President-elect Trump, Biden congratulated him, the White House said. Biden 'emphasized the importance of working to bring the country together,' and said he was committed to ensuring a smooth transition, according to the White House. Staff for Biden and Trump plan to coordinate a specific date for the two to meet at the White House in the near future. Biden is expected to address the nation Thursday to discuss the election results and the transition between presidents. What changed for Trump between the 2020 and 2024 elections? NBC News, in conjunction with a consortium of news organizations, conducted exit polls across 10 key states both at polling locations and over the phone. Those states are Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin. One of the largest shifts was among Hispanic voters - particularly Hispanic men. In 2020, 32% of Hispanic voters went for Trump, the data says. In 2024, Trump won 45% of Hispanic voters. Trump also won over a larger share of voters between the ages of 18 and 29, counting 36% in 2020 and 42% in 2024. Check out all the data here. Workers continued construction of a platform outside the U.S. Capitol for Inauguration Day. Here's a look at their progress on Wednesday, after Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election and became president-elect. Justice Department officials have been evaluating how to wind down the two federal criminal cases against President-elect Donald Trump before he takes office to comply with longstanding department policy that a sitting president can't be prosecuted, two people familiar with the matter tell NBC News. The latest discussions stand in contrast with the pre-election legal posture of special counsel Jack Smith, who in recent weeks took significant steps in the election interference case against Trump without regard to the electoral calendar. But the sources say DOJ officials have come to grips with the fact that no trial is possible any time soon in either the Jan. 6 case or the classified documents matter - both of which are mired in legal issues that would likely prompt an appeal all the way to the Supreme Court, even if Trump had lost the election. Now that Trump will become president again, DOJ officials see no room to pursue either criminal case against him - and no point in continuing to litigate them in the weeks before he takes office, the people said.
