second term will look nothing like his first Harris ran on positivity. She ran on inclusivity. She convinced a party full of insiders who had gone into the year ready to write her off for the 2028 Democratic nomination that they should go all in on her for 2024. At the beginning of the night Tuesday, when victory seemed just hours away, the people who came to what was supposed to be Harris' celebration were dancing. A Howard University graduate seemed about to walk into history in the heart of her old HBCU campus. At one point, the camera found the student body president in the crowd and she blushed as she saw herself projected on the big screen. Anticipation mounted and cheers went out with every state called for Harris. Seconds after North Carolina was called for Trump, the audio was switched off the big screens and music blasted through the speakers to try to salvage the energy. Most kept staring silently at the numbers, trying to make sense of what had happened. In state capitals with Democratic governors, break-glass plans that they had started to believe they would never need are getting yanked off the shelves - to protect access to abortion medications, but also to work up other protections from what they believe will be not just a stringent, but vindictive, administration. Early thoughts about who will be running and how in 2028 are starting to circulate. That was not on the minds of the people who started streaming out of the Howard campus early Wednesday before campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond had even finished telling them that there was still counting to be done. 'We try to do it right, we try to be good Christians,' one woman said to the man walking with her. 'We've got to take a page out of their book.' 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.
