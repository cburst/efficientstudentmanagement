By Gene Maddaus Senior Media Writer Kamala Harris conceded the presidential race on Wednesday afternoon, telling supporters at Howard University in Washington, D.C. 'do not despair,' and urging them to keep fighting at the ballot box and in the courts. Harris began by saying she would work with President Trump to ensure a peaceful transfer of power, drawing an unspoken contrast with the violence and chaos of four years ago. 'We must accept the results of this election,' she said. 'A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election we accept the results.' But, she added, that does not mean she will concede the fight for 'freedom, opportunity, dignity and fairness' that animated her campaign. 'We owe loyalty not to a president or a party, but to the Constitution of the United States,' she said. Harris spoke in front of a cheering crowd at her alma mater. Among those on hand were former Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Tim Walz, her running mates, as well as the candidates' families. At the close of her speech, she invoked Howard's motto - 'truth and service' - saying it was important to overcome setbacks. 'I know many people feel like we are entering a dark time,' she said. 'For the benefit of us all, I hope that is not the case.' Harris acknowledged that her younger supporters may be feeling 'sad or disappointed.' 'But please know it's going to be OK,' she said. 'Sometimes the fight takes a while. That doesn't mean we won't win. The important thing is don't ever give up.' 0 Comments Comments are moderated.
