Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday called President-elect Donald Trump to concede the 2024 presidential race, and a representative for Trump said the two 'agreed on the importance of unifying the country.' Trump was declared the winner of the presidency by The Associated Press (AP) early Wednesday morning when he pushed over the required threshold of 270 Electoral College votes. So far, he beat Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, in the swing states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia and North Carolina and 22 Republican-leaning states. He also secured four of the five electoral votes in Nebraska and one in Maine, bringing his total to 292 Electoral College votes. 'President Donald J. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris spoke by phone earlier today where she congratulated him on his historic victory,' Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement. 'President Trump acknowledged Vice President Harris on her strength, professionalism, and tenacity throughout the campaign, and both leaders agreed on the importance of unifying the country.' According to an email sent to her campaign staff, Harris called Trump on Wednesday. 'Just a few moments ago, the Vice President connected with President Trump to concede the race,' the email from campaign chief Jen O'Malley Dillon said. Dillion said losing was 'unfathomably painful' and will 'take a long time to process,' but that Harris said she would work with President Joe Biden 'to ensure a peaceful transfer of power, unlike what we saw in 2020.' 'It is hard. This will take a long time to process,' the email added. 'But the work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump Presidency starts now.' Meanwhile, Trump gave a victory speech early Wednesday morning at the Palm Beach Convention Center in Florida, hours before the AP declared him the winner. 'We overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible and it is now clear that we've achieved the most incredible political thing, look what happened, is this crazy? But it's a political victory that our country has never seen before, nothing like this,' he said. 'I want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honor of being elected your 47th president and your 45th president.' Trump said his second term will be 'the golden age of America' and vowed to fight for every American's future. 'And every citizen, I will fight for you, for your family and your future, every single day I will be fighting for you with every breath in my body, I will not rest until we have delivered the strong, safe and prosperous America that our children deserve and that you deserve, he said.
