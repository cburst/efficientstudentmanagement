Kamala Harris of the Democrat party has 67,951,593 votes (47.5%) Donald Trump of the Republican party has 72,659,067 votes (50.8%) Kamala Harris, 60, lost to Donald Trump in the 2024 US presidential election. Here's all you need to know about her. The Democratic candidate was beaten by Donald Trump who received more than 270 electoral college votes. Her Republican rival will be sworn in as president in January 2025. Harris was Joe Biden's running mate in 2020 when he defeated Trump in an acrimonious election campaign. She became the first black vice-president and the first woman in the role. Unique circumstances propelled Harris into the contest. Biden stepped aside in July and backed his deputy to take over, giving her an unexpected shot at the White House. There were no Democratic challengers so what is usually a campaign over 12 to 18 months, taking on party rivals in a gruelling fight for the nomination, was in her case compressed into less than four months. Her central promise in the campaign was to provide freedom of opportunity to working people through economic prosperity and expanded access to parental leave and childcare. Harris advocated for reproductive freedoms for women as some states limit access to abortion. She also backed the freedom to vote and freedom from gun violence - while being a gun-owner herself. Her critics questioned why as part of the Biden administration she did not already act on some of these promises, and she became the target of criticism on the issue of illegal immigration. In 2019, she took on nearly a dozen Democratic rivals to become the presidential nominee but dropped out before the first primary contest after a lacklustre campaign. Before she ran for the White House, some of her biggest moments featured her grilling witnesses in Congressional hearings. One famous example was when she asked Brett Kavanaugh, who was facing questions in order to become a Supreme Court justice, about abortion. He was unable to answer when she enquired whether he could think of any laws that gave the government the power to make decisions about men's bodies. Cancer researcher and civil rights activist Shyamala Gopalan Harris was the primary carer of the young Kamala after divorcing Jamaican-born Donald Harris. Shyamala immersed her daughter in her Indian heritage but also took her to a black cultural centre where the young Harris was inspired by trailblazing politician Shirley Chisholm and singer Nina Simone. Harris describes her mother as 'the most important person' in her life. After spending five years at school in Montreal where her mother was working, Harris enrolled in the black university, Howard, in Washington DC. She returned to the West Coast to begin her career as a prosecutor and soon rose through the ranks to become the top lawyer in California. She entered the US Senate in 2017. Entertainment lawyer Doug Emhoff was set up on a date with Harris by a mutual friend, a client of his. They married in 2014 and she became stepmother to his then teenage children, Cole and Ella, who call her 'Momala'. 'Our time as a family is Sunday dinner,' she told Elle magazine. 'Cole sets the table and picks the music, Ella makes beautiful desserts, Doug acts as my sous-chef, and I cook.' Harris has pushed for a law that would enshrine reproductive rights nationwide and vowed to fight any moves to reduce abortion access. She planned to address the cost of living by introducing a ban on price-gouging on groceries and help for first-time home buyers. She adopted a much stricter position on the southern border where illegal
