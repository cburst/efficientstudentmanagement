Trump's campaign says he has accepted President Biden's invitation to meet at the White House to discuss the presidential transition. No date has been announced yet but Steven Cheung, Trump's communications director, said it would 'take place shortly.' Cheung said Trump 'very much appreciated' Biden's congratulatory call on Wednesday. Biden, in a White House-issued statement, praised Harris as 'a tremendous partner and public servant full of integrity, courage, and character.' It was Biden's first public comment in the aftermath of Trump's victory. The president also noted that Harris entered the campaign under 'extraordinary circumstances,' a nod to his dropping out of the race 108 days before Election Day amid growing pressure from within his party after his cataclysmic debate performance against Trump. Biden added that Harris 'stepped up and led a historic campaign that embodied what's possible when guided by a strong moral compass and a clear vision for a nation that is more free, more just, and full of more opportunities for all Americans.' A disaffected electorate wanted former President Donald Trump to return to the White House, a blatant rejection of Vice President Kamala Harris and her nearly four years with President Joe Biden. The Republican's victory came from a public so put off by America's trajectory that they welcomed his brash and disruptive approach. About 3 in 10 voters said they wanted total upheaval in how the country is run, according to AP VoteCast, a sweeping survey of more than 120,000 voters nationwide.

Both nationwide and in key battleground states, the Republicans won over voters who were alarmed about the economy and prioritized more aggressive enforcement of immigration laws.
