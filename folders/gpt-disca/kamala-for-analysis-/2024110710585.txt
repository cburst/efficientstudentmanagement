Torres' comments came in the aftermath of the initial 2024 election results, which found that Vice President Harris had less favorability among Latino and Hispanic voters than President Biden did in 2020. According to a Fox News Voter Analysis, Biden garnered 63% of Latino support in 2020 while Harris only had 54% this year. Another Fox News Voter Analysis found that support for Trump among Latino and Hispanic voters jumped from 35% in 2020 to 41% in 2024. Fox News Digital's Andrea Margolis contributed to this report.

The televised address will come days after Vice President Kamala Harris lost to President-elect Trump in Tuesday's election. Harris conceded the election Wednesday. In a letter, her campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon called it 'unfathomably painful.' 'This will take a long time to process. But the work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump Presidency starts now,' she vowed. Catholic voters across the country swung massively towards Donald Trump in the 2024 election, contributing to his surprise blowout victory on election night.Catholics were evenly split between President Joe Biden and Trump in 2020, with 50 percent favoring Trump to 49 percent favoring Biden. According to exit polling collected by Fox News on election night, Catholics across the country swung nine percentage points in Trump's favor, with the former and now-future president winning Catholics by 10 points. Bill Donohue, president of the religious civil rights group the Catholic League, told Fox News Digital that Catholics resoundingly rejected Harris because of what he called a 'clear animus against Catholics.'
