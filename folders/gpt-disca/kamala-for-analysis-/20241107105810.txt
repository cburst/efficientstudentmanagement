abortion, as part of the fight she will continue to uphold: 'We will continue to wage this fight in the voting booth, in the courtroom, in the public square.' Harris also comforted her younger supporters, saying 'to the young people who are watching, it is okay to feel sad and disappointed. But please know it's going to be okay.' 'This is not a time to throw up our hands, but to roll up our sleeves,' Harris added. Vice President Kamala Harris' abiding silence following President-elect Trump's victory suggests an inability to step up as a leader for her base, legal scholars say. The Democratic nominee has not yet spoken to her supporters, nor encouraged them to accept the election results, since Trump was named the victor of the 2024 presidential race early Wednesday morning. Two sources confirmed to Fox that the Harris campaign was radio silent Wednesday morning and did not provide talking points to surrogates, donors or influencers. The vice president is expected to deliver remarks at Howard University at 4 p.m. EST on Wednesday, where she will address Americans for the first time since losing the presidential race to Trump. However, analysts say she should not have waited until the afternoon after the election to address her base. Jonathan Turley, a legal scholar and a Fox News contributor, said Trump's clear path to victory should have prompted her to concede sooner. 'The true test of leadership is to step forward when it is most needed. Half of this population is deeply aggrieved by this decision. Part of that angst and anxiety was fueled by the rage rhetoric and panic politics on the left, including the Harris campaign,' Turley told Fox News Digital. The Fox News Decision Desk projects that Democrat Rep. Elissa Slotkin will defeat former Republican Rep. Mike Rogers, to succeed longtime Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan. Slotkin's challenger, Republican Mike Rogers, served as a Representative in Michigan's 8th Congressional district from 2001 through 2015. Slotkin is projected to win with 99% of the vote reported with a narrow margin of 48.6% over Rogers' 48.3%. She is a former CIA Middle East analyst and current Representative for Michigan's 7th Congressional district. At least three Senate seats have been flipped thus far for the GOP in the 2024 elections. Vice President Kamala Harris standing up her devastated Democratic supporters last night is drawing attention to a similar choice by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in November 2016. Both Democrats would have become the country's first female president if they beat Trump. In 2016, when the race was called for Trump, Clinton did not address her supporters until the following morning. Harris will speak to supporters Wednesday evening. At the time, some critics blasted Clinton for not giving a consolation speech that same night at the Javits Center in New York. Clinton instead allowed her campaign manager, John Podesta, to briefly speak to supporters. On the following day, Clinton urged her supporters to 'accept this result, and then look to the future.' 'Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead,' she said. Likewise, on Tuesday night, Harris supporters trickled out of the watch party at Howard University once they learned from a Harris spokesperson she would not be addressing the crowd. Users on social media quickly took note and critiqued the VP for not showing face after supporters waited hours for her to come out. Harris-Walz campaign manager David Plouffe took to social media to thank staff and lament Vice President
