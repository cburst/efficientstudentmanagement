By Ted Johnson Political Editor Facing a crowd of supporters, a number of them wiping away tears, Kamala Harris delivered a concession speech Wednesday in which she urged them to not despair and not give up at a critical period in American history. 'To everyone who is watching: Do not despair. This is not a time to throw up our hands. This is a time to roll up our sleeves,' Harris said to the crowd at Howard University. Many in the crowd were at the same place Tuesday night, hopeful that it would be a victory celebration for winning the 2024 presidential election. Instead, the mood turned grim when it was apparent that the election was shifting Donald Trump's way. Harris made a point of noting that, in her phone call with Trump today, she told him that 'we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power,' a contrast to the president-elect's refusal to do so four years ago. 'A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results,' Harris said. 'That principle, as much as any other, distinguishes democracy from monarchy or tyranny, and anyone who seeks to public trust must honor it.' 'At the same time, in our nation, we owe loyalty not to a president or a party but to the Constitution of the United States,' she said. Harris encouraged her supporters to 'never give up.' 'While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign,' she said. Harris was joined by her husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, and her running mate, Tim Walz, who was there with his wife Gwen. 'There's an adage an historian once called a law of history, true of every society across the ages,' Harris said. 'The adage is, 'Only when it is dark enough can you see the stars.' I know many people feel like we are entering a dark time, but for the benefit of us all, I hope that is not the case. But here's the thing, America, if it is, let us fill the sky with the light of a brilliant billion of stars, the light of optimism, of faith, of truth and service.' Later, President Joe Biden issued a statement on Harris. 'What America saw today was the Kamala Harris I know and deeply admire. She's been a tremendous partner and public servant full of integrity, courage, and character. Under extraordinary circumstances, she stepped up and led a historic campaign that embodied what's possible when guided by a strong moral compass and a clear vision for a nation that is more free, more just, and full of more opportunities for all Americans. 'As I've said before, selecting Kamala was the very first decision I made when I became the nominee for president in 2020. It was the best decision I made. Her story represents the best of America's story. And as she made clear today, I have no doubt that she'll continue writing that story. 'She will continue the fight with purpose, determination, and joy. She will continue to be a champion for all Americans. Above all, she will continue to be a leader our children will look up to for generations to come as she puts her stamp on America's future.' Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

WASHINGTON - Vice President Kamala Harris conceded the 2024 presidential election during a speech to dejected supporters on the campus of Howard University late Wednesday afternoon while vowing to keep fighting against a 'dark time' for some Americans. Harris, 60, addressed a subdued crowd at her alma mater's main quad, known as 'The Yard,' at about 4:25 p.m. - roughly 16 hours after campaign staff announced early Wednesday morning that she would not speak at an election watch party, prompting a mass exodus from the once-bustling event packed with thousands of students and young activists. 'I know many people feel like we're entering a dark time,' Harris said. 'But for the benefit of us all, I hope that's not the case.' Harris acknowledged former president turned President-elect Donald Trump, who regained the White House overnight Wednesday in a stunning political comeback, won the election to become the 47th U.S. president, spoiling her own quest to hold the nation's highest office as the first female and woman of color. 'My heart is full today, full of gratitude,' she told several thousand supporters in a concession speech peppered with optimism. 'Hear me when I say the light of America's promise will always burn bright.' Harris, whose rise to the Democratic nomination followed President Biden's withdrawal from the race in late July, did not publicly signal her political future on Wednesday as the outgoing vice president, but said Americans 'must accept' results of the election. She promised to 'never give up' her desire to protect citizens of all backgrounds. 'We will never give up the fight for our democracy, the rule of law, of the rule of justice and the sacred idea that everyone of us, no matter who we are or where we start out, have certain fundamental rights and freedoms that must be upheld,' Harris said. 'We will continue to wage this fight.' Harris said she called President-elect Trump earlier Wednesday to concede the race and work with President Biden to ensure a smooth transition of power. 'She also made clear that she hopes he will be a president for all Americans,' Harris' campaign manager, Jen O'Malley Dillon, reportedly told staff in an email, adding that the vice president and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, would speak directly to all campaign staffers. 'I'll leave you with this: losing is incredibly painful,' O'Malley Dillon continued. 'It is hard. This will take a long time to process. But the work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump presidency starts now.' Steven Cheung, Trump's campaign communications director, confirmed Harris congratulated the Republican on the 'historic' victory, propelling the 78-year-old back to the White House for a second time. 'President Trump acknowledged Vice President Harris on her strength, professionalism, and tenacity throughout the campaign, and both leaders agreed on the importance of unifying the country,' Cheung said in a statement to Newsweek. Trump's lopsided victory in the race, which had been expected by many observers to be an extremely tight contest, serves as a stunning blow for Democrats and Harris, who declined to speak late Tuesday at the watch party attended primarily by current and former Howard University students. She graduated from the historically black college in 1986, four years after first walking onto grounds of 'The Mecca' to follow in the footsteps of Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and further cultivate her lifelong interest in law. While at Howard, Harris majored in political science and economics and served as a
