Bison who are changing the world to make it a better place right now and for future generations. No matter the outcome of the 2024 presidential election, one thing is certain. Upon her election as vice president of the United States, Kamala Devi Harris became the highest-ranking woman ever in public service. On Harris' journey to history, she has broken barrier after barrier and shattered glass ceilings into millions of pieces. Most recently, she became the first HBCU graduate to ever receive a major presidential nomination. For other institutions, she might represent an anomaly of excellence. At Howard, she is simply a part of our lineage of leadership. Because you went to Howard University, you have a responsibility to keep reaching for that bar and keep serving.' In the expansive temporal tome that is Howard history, Harris occupies plenty of pages; First Black district attorney of San Francisco; First Black and first woman of South Asian descent to become a United States senator from California. The only woman to be part of a winning presidential ticket. Harris has always made it crystal clear that her public service is 'for the people,' meaning all of the people. However, her HBCU roots are dear to her, and she has seized every opportunity to uplift her Alma Mater. After she launched her first run for the presidency in 2019, she held her first press conference at Howard. Throughout her vice presidency, she returned many times to discuss economic empowerment and reproductive rights. She tossed the opening coin at the 2023 Celebration Bowl in Atlanta, during which the Howard Bison took on the Florida A&M Rattlers, and invited Bison athletes to visit her in the Naval Observatory. She came back home to Howard many times during her historic 2024 presidential campaign, using the campus as a place of comfort and renewal. In so many meaningful ways, both high profile and subtle, she has shown her devotion to her Alma Mater and her interest in its continued advancement. Tens of thousands of Bison around the country are extremely proud and grateful. Much of her success can be attributed to her tight embrace of Howard's core principles of truth and service. She reinforced the importance of this principle when talking to Howard graduates at the University's 149th Commencement ceremony in 2017. 'Speaking the truth means you must speak up, and you must speak out, even when you are not asked,' she said. 'Even when it is uncomfortable or inconvenient.' 'The thing that Howard taught me is that you can do any collection of things, and not one thing to the exclusion of the other.' In Fall 1982, Harris made the trek to Washington, D.C., to the hallowed grounds of Howard University. She already certain of who she was - and, seemingly, who she desired to be. In her 2019 memoir 'The Truths We Hold,' Harris delved into her abiding passion for social justice and how that interest -by one of the nation's most iconic attorneys and civil rights icons - influenced her decision to attend Howard University for her postsecondary education. 'I wanted to get off on the right foot,'' Harris wrote. 'And what better place to do that, I thought, than at Thurgood Marshall's alma mater?' Harris pursued political science and economics as her majors and immediately demonstrated both her intellectual curiosity and spirit for service during her years at The Mecca. Her first campaign came as a first-year undergraduate for the Liberal Arts Student Council. She later chaired the Economics Society and became a standout on the University's speech and debate team, refining the
