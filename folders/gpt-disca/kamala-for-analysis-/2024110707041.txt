The vice president set the tone for how Democrats can responsibly resist in the coming four years. Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a crisp concession speech on Wednesday afternoon at Howard University. The 60-year-old acknowledged, with grace, dignity and a dash of hope, that she had lost the presidency to former president Donald Trump. She didn't make excuses. Instead, she set the tone for how Democrats can responsibly approach Mr. Trump in the coming four years - defending their core values while cooperating for the best interests of the country. 'While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign,' she said, citing freedom and dignity for all Americans as the aspirations that guided her effort. She offered a counterpoint to the worst-case scenarios circulating on the political left, to the effect that this was the last election of a doomed democracy. Most important, she promised to assist in a peaceful transition of power. Subscribe to comment and get the full experience. Choose your plan
