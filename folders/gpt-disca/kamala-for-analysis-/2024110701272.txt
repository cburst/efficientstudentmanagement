that 4 in 10 voters said immigrants living in the US illegally should be deported to their country of origin, up from around 3 in 10 who said the same in 2020. And though Harris tried to spend the home stretch of her campaign underlining that her administration would not be a continuation of Biden's, she failed to clearly outline her own policies, often skirting around issues instead of addressing perceived failures head on. The Harris campaign had hoped to reassemble the voting base that powered Biden's 2020 victory, winning over the core Democratic constituencies of black, Latino and young voters as well as making further gains with college-educated suburban voters. But she underperformed with these key voting blocs. She lost 13 points with Latino voters, two points with black voters, and six points with voters under 30, according to exit polls, which may change as votes are counted, but are considered representative of trends. Independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who lost the 2016 Democratic presidential primary to Hillary Clinton and the 2020 primary to Biden, said in a statement it was 'no great surprise' that working class voters abandoned the party. 'First, it was the white working class, and now it is Latino and black workers as well. While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change,' he said. 'And they're right.' While women largely threw their support behind Harris over Trump, the vice-president's lead did not exceed the margins that her campaign had hoped her historic candidacy would turn out. And she was unable to deliver on her ambitions of winning over suburban Republican women, losing 53% of white women. In the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion, Democrats had hoped her focus on the fight for reproductive rights would deliver a decisive victory. While some 54% of female voters cast their ballots for Harris, it fell short of the 57% who backed Biden in 2020, according to exit poll data. Even before she was catapulted to the top of the ticket, Harris had sought to frame the race as a referendum on Trump, not Biden. The former California prosecutor leaned into her law enforcement record to prosecute the case against the former president. But her nascent campaign opted to ditch Biden's core argument that Trump posed an existential threat to democracy, prioritising a forward-looking 'joyful' message about protecting personal freedoms and preserving the middle class. In the final stretch, however, Harris made a tactical decision to again highlight the dangers of a second Trump presidency, calling the president a 'fascist' and campaigning with disaffected Republicans fed up with his rhetoric. After Trump's former White House Chief of Staff, John Kelly, told the New York Times that Trump spoke approvingly about Adolf Hitler, Harris delivered remarks outside her official residence describing the president as 'unhinged and unstable'. 'Kamala Harris lost this election when she pivoted to focus almost exclusively on attacking Donald Trump,' veteran Republican pollster Frank Luntz said on Tuesday night. 'Voters already know everything there is about Trump - but they still wanted to know more about Harris' plans for the first hour, first day, first month and first year of her administration.' 'It was a colossal failure for her campaign to shine the spotlight on Trump more than on Harris's own ideas,' he added. Ultimately, the winning coalition Harris needed to beat Trump never materialised, and voters'
