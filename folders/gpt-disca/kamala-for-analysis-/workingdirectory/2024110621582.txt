He doesn't like you unless you are richer than him! The photographer is ecstatic over getting that hand gesture and halo effect. Me too. Don' t think he will be able find one of DJT summoning his minions from hell but I have stickers of that as well as Boebert in clown face.lol. ANGELIC. or maybe not That and a subway token will get you to work. Until Dems think hard about WHY they lost, they will never win another national election again.

freshman student council representative. She also joined the debate team and pledged Alpha Kappa Alpha, a prestigious sorority founded at the historically black college in 1908. Harris characterized the university as 'home' in a 2021 Instagram post, recalling her time decades earlier protesting apartheid in South Africa alongside other young political activists and Howard students along the National Mall. 'For me, Howard is home,' Harris wrote. 'At Howard, you can be a football player and a valedictorian. You can be a budding computer scientist and a poet. You can have a 4.0, intern on Capitol Hill, and still find time to hang out with friends on the weekend.' At Tuesday's watch party, prior to the race being called, many supporters were cautiously optimistic despite returns reflecting Trump's growing lead that never relented. 'We're really proud to support her and the impact that she's made thus far, regardless of the outcome,' Howard University junior Ajoi Adams, 20, told Newsweek late Tuesday prior to Trump's win. 'It's not over until God says it's over.' Sana-Alyse Muhammad, 23, who graduated from Howard University with a psychology degree last year, said she proudly voted for her fellow Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority member. 'I'm overwhelmed with pride,' Muhammad told Newsweek late Tuesday steps from the university's main quad as she awaited election returns during Harris' watch party. 'I have so much hope and I think we can bring it home.' Muhammad said had been constantly checking news sites for election updates and felt anxious yet hopeful about the prospect of a Howard University graduate like herself capturing the White House. 'We've been reading up on the 'red mirage,'' Muhammad said. 'But we just need to give it time for those votes to come in.' Some of Harris' backers at Tuesday's watch party, however, were dismayed that she chose not to speak, despite the bleak outlook as Trump racked up wins across the country, particularly in battleground states. 'I'll say this, it was bad form for Kamala Harris to skip addressing supporters last night at Howard University,' Troy Donte Prestwood wrote on X early Wednesday. 'Many of us stood for hours eating dry granola & listening to a bad DJ. We knew the results weren't looking good. At least thank your supporters.' Harris closed her remarks Wednesday acknowledging the pain of the lopsided loss. 'To the young people who are watching, it is OK to feel sad and disappointed,' she said. 'But please know it is going to be okay. On the campaign, I would often say when we fight, we win. But here's the thing, here's the thing. Sometimes the fight takes awhile. That doesn't mean we won't win. The important thing is don't ever give up.' Joshua Rhett Miller is a Newsweek chief investigative reporter based in New York.
