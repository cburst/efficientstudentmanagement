In an opinion article, Bezos defended the move, arguing it would help restore public trust by ending a practice he says creates a 'perception of non-independence' and bias. Chris Cann Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell congratulated Trump on his victory in the presidential race on Wednesday, telling reporters at the Capitol that he commended the former president for 'running a sharper operation this time.' McConnell, who's been the minority leader of the Senate since 2021 and will be stepping down from his leadership role this month, also said that he 'had really hoped I'd be able to hand over to my successor, the majority.' 'Based on the fact that we haven't got all the results, and we certainly already know we're going to be in the majority, we're hopeful that that might actually grow some,' he said. One of the most gratifying parts of Republicans having Senate control, McConnell said, is that the filibuster 'will stand.' 'There won't be any new states admitted to give a partisan advantage to the other side, and we'll quit beating up the Supreme Court every time we don't like a decision they make,' he said. So I think this shifting to a Republican Senate majority helps control the guardrails to keep people who want to change the rules in order to achieve something they think is worthwhile, not successful.

Netanyahu said they spoke about Israel's security and 'the Iranian threat.' Trump has long been close to Netanyahu and in his first term was widely viewed as one of the most pro-Israel U.S. presidents of modern times.

It's not immediately clear how Trump will deal the war in Gaza. Dozens of leaders and U.S. allies released statements expressing well wishes and congratulations after Trump won the election. Among them was Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose country is trying to determine whether Trump's White House will cut back on U.S. military aid for Ukraine or nudge it toward a peace deal with Russia. 'I appreciate President Trump's commitment to the 'peace through strength' approach in global affairs,' Zelenskyy said. 'This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer.' Kim Hjelmgaard Four years ago, Trump by most measures was a political pariah. Now he's a president in waiting. Rising from the ashes after a bonfire of scandal fueled by four criminal prosecutions, two impeachments and a failed insurrection, Trump swept aside dire warnings that he could bring American democracy to an end and instead used the democratic system as the ultimate vindication. Now he will become the second president in history the first since Grover Cleveland more than century ago to serve nonconsecutive terms. A politician rejected by voters in 2020 and abandoned by many in his party after the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Trump is poised to again become the most powerful man in the world.
