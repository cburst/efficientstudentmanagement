By Remy Tumin and Katie Rogers Vice President Kamala Harris will address the nation on Wednesday afternoon in what is expected to be her concession speech, officially bringing to a close a furious race to stop former President Donald J. Trump from returning to the White House. Ms. Harris is slated to speak at 4 p.m. Eastern time from Howard University, in Washington, according to a campaign official briefed on her plans. The university, Ms. Harris's alma mater, is the same place that was meant to host a victory party on Tuesday evening had she won the election. But as results came in and Mr. Trump's lead strengthened, she never made an appearance. Ms. Harris will call Mr. Trump soon to concede the election, according to a senior official familiar with her plans who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly. The Harris campaign sent a message to supporters in Washington on Wednesday inviting them to attend the event and signing off with 'deep appreciation.' Ms. Harris graduated from Howard in 1986 and has referred to her time at the historically Black university as 'a place that shaped her.' Mr. Trump declared victory in the early hours of Wednesday before securing the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win. In his victory speech in West Palm Beach, Fla., Mr. Trump declared that he was the leader of 'the greatest political movement of all time.' 'We overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible,' he said, adding that he would take office with an 'unprecedented and powerful mandate.' Remy Tumin is a reporter for The Times covering breaking news and other topics. More about Remy Tumin Katie Rogers is a White House correspondent.
