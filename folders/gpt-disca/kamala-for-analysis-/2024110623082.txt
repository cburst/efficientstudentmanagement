okay. On the campaign, I would often say, 'When we fight, We win.' But here's the thing, sometimes the fight takes a while. That doesn't mean we won't win,' she said. 'The important thing is don't ever give up. Don't ever stop trying to make the world a better place. You have power. And don't you ever listen when anyone tells you something is impossible because it has never been done before.' Clinton also specifically called out to young people and women in her 2016 concession speech. 'To the young people in particular, I hope you will hear this. I have...spent my entire adult life fighting for what I believe in. I've had successes, and I've had setbacks. Sometimes, really painful ones. Many of you are at the beginning of your professional public and political careers. You will have successes and setbacks, too,' she said. 'This loss hurts, but please never stop believing that fighting for what's right is worth it.' She continued: 'We need you to keep up these fights now and for the rest of your lives. And to all the women, and especially the young women, who put their faith in this campaign and in me, I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion. 'I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but some day someone will and hopefully sooner than we might think right now. And to all the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams.'
