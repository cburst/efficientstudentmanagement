Broadcast networks and The Associated Press had Trump on the precipice of returning to the presidency when he took the stage in Florida at 2:25 a.m. to declare victory. Many journalists warned viewers that determining the winner could be a protracted process that could take several days like it had in 2020. Yet from the first hints provided by exit poll results shortly after 5 p.m. EST, the election night story moved methodically in Trump's direction. Read more about how the media covered election night Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement late Wednesday, saying that 'we all pray for America's success under the next administration,' but did not make mention of Trump by name. Pelosi was seen as the architect of the Democratic party's strategic shift from Joe Biden to Kamala Harris as top of their ticket over the summer. The California Democrat has been Trump's biggest critic, saying previously that her goal is to ensure Trump never enters the White House again. 'The peaceful transfer of power is the cornerstone of our democracy,' Pelosi said. 'After every election, we all have a responsibility to come together and find common ground.' Former Vice President Mike Pence congratulated Trump for winning a second term in office, writing yet another awkward chapter in the relationship between the president-elect and his former running mate. 'The American people have spoken and Karen and I send our sincere congratulations to President-Elect Donald Trump and his family on his election as 47th President of the United States,' Pence wrote on behalf of him and his wife. The former vice president also congratulated Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who ran in place of Pence as Trump's running mate. 'We will continue to pray for all those in authority and urge every American to join us in praying for our incoming President, Vice President and elected officials at every level,' Pence concluded. Pence's relationship with Trump fractured after the former vice president declined to follow the Republican president's wishes and went ahead with certifying the 2020 election. Trump did not hold back in his contempt for Pence, questioning his judgment and calling him 'delusional' on the campaign trail. Pence, in turn, declined to endorse his one-time running mate.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) American presidential elections are a moment when the nation holds up a mirror to look at itself. They are a reflection of values and dreams, of grievances and scores to be settled. The results say much about a country's character, future and core beliefs. On Tuesday, America looked into that mirror and more voters saw former president Donald Trump, delivering him a far-reaching victory in the most contested states. He won for many reasons. One of them was that a formidable number of Americans, from different angles, said the state of democracy was a prime concern. Even as Trump prevailed, most voters said they were very or somewhat concerned that electing Trump would bring the U.S. closer to being an authoritarian country, where a single leader has unchecked power, according to the AP VoteCast survey. Still, 1 in 10 of those voters backed him anyway. Nearly 4 in 10 Trump voters said they wanted complete upheaval in how the country is run.
