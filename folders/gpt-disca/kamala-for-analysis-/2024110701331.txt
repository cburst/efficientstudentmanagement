View all partners On the Saturday before Election Day, I travelled from Washington DC to Charlotte, North Carolina, to attend one of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris' last campaign rallies. It was extraordinary how many women were in the crowd - young Black women in particular. There were also older, suburban, white women who looked like they could have been Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren's sister or cousin. There were many men, who were just as enthusiastic. But they were far outnumbered by the women. Harris was warm and charismatic, and the women in the crowd had such a huge reaction to her. They saved their biggest cheers for her lines about reproductive rights - North Carolina has very strict abortion restrictions, which are affecting women across the state. Overall, though, I got a sense of cautious optimism from the crowd. There was absolutely no complacency. People were very nervous and anxious about the impending election against Donald Trump, especially since North Carolina was one of the seven key battleground states. You could sense a kind of distrust in the broader American electorate. One of the focal points of Harris' campaign was her outreach to women voters. She made this election about freedom for women to make decisions about their own bodies and reproductive health. And while this message did resonate with many women - in particular younger women - it didn't with others. According to exit polls by the Associated Press, 47% of women over the age of 45 voted for Trump, as well as 43% of women aged 18-44. More than half of white women overall also voted for Trump (53%). Exit polls by CNN also found that while Harris did better than Hillary Clinton in 2016 with white women with college degrees, white women without degrees overwhelmingly supported Trump. This says a lot about the decisions that some women made in the election. It seems possible that what Trump was able to do was give these women enough wiggle room to reconcile what might seem to be otherwise irreconcilable. For instance, they could perhaps believe that Trump wouldn't actually implement a national abortion ban, simply because he has said he would not. Or they may simply believe that Trump's policies wouldn't necessarily apply to them. I think this led to some potentially cynical decision-making among voters, much as there was in 2016. And as expected, Harris also did worse than Trump among men. At least some of this - alongside the voting patterns of white women - comes down to structural racism and misogyny and the toxic mix of the two. Trump's entire campaign was structured around appealing to men and mobilising them to vote, in particular younger men. There was clearly a level of discomfort among men with the idea of a woman president. And there'll be a lot of recriminations about Harris' inability to appeal to those men, even though she had an entire event devoted to 'white dudes' and put forth an economic plan specifically for Black men. I think she did run an effective campaign overall, judging it on the basis of campaign tactics, but the underlying structures and divisions of American politics were hard to overcome. Trump didn't create these divisions, but he exploits them like no one else can. This is also partly because the Democrats -
