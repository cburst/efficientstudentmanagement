Harris should have been nicer to 'bros.' Maybe she wasted too much money on digital ads. Maybe she should have steered clear of lefty icons like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, or distanced herself from her boss more explicitly. Yet many had nothing but praise for Harris' polished run. 'I can't sit here and be like, 'She didn't come to Michigan enough.' She was here almost every day,' says Representative Haley Stevens, who was re-elected to represent her district in the northern Detroit suburbs. 'They didn't take anything in the Blue Wall for granted.' 'I think she ran the best campaign anyone in her position possibly could have. But that doesn't mean she was the right person,' says former Democratic congressman Tom Malinowski of New Jersey. 'In hindsight, I think there is a strong argument for having had an open competitive process in place' to replace Biden on the ticket, Malinowski says. Read More: World Leaders React to Trump's Win. The party's soul-searching is likely to extend to the groups it relies on to turn out the vote. Take, for instance, NextGen America, the party's biggest youth-vote machine, which spent almost $56 million, hired 256 staffers and recruited almost 30,000 volunteers. It was a massive undertaking-and yet Harris won just 55% of voters under the age of 30, lagging Biden's performance by five points. Another group, Swing Left, raised $25 million from Red State Democrats for on-the-brink districts, knocked on almost 350,000 battleground doors in the final weekend, and placed more than a half-million calls in that final push. The celebrity-tinged GOTV machine didn't work. Yet to some observers, focusing on campaign minutia misses the bigger picture-that Harris may have been doomed from the start by forces outside of her control. 'No incumbent party has ever won with a president with a 40% approval rating or under,' says Axelrod. 'No party has won with people's attitudes about the economy what they were.' Harris, Axelrod argues, had the added challenge of running while the country is still suffering from post-pandemic PTSD, which helped Republicans tap into anti-establishment rage. 'These forces were so large that I'm not sure where there are strategic or tactical decisions that could have changed the outcome,' says Axelrod. 'At the end of the day, being the VP of an Administration that people wanted to fire may have been an insurmountable obstacle.' Another Democratic strategist with deep ties to organized labor suggests the stars were aligned for Democrats to fail, even against a candidate as flawed as Trump: 'Maybe this was actually just inevitable as a result of years of economic concerns and inflation-like [what] happened to pretty much every incumbent in the entire world.' Yet even considering world trends and economic cycles, some saw in the verdict an unmistakable sign of misogyny. To this camp, it's hard to ignore that Trump has now won twice against female opponents, while losing to an old white man. Rodell Mollineau, a former senior aide to Democratic Senate Leader Harry Reid, notes that despite his overwhelming victory, Trump was an unpopular candidate himself. 'They picked him over a Black woman,' Mollineau says. 'This is a tough pill to swallow.' It's a point not lost on Biden's shrinking circle of defenders. ''Everyone who destroyed Biden and pushed him out, got the race they demanded,' says a Democratic state committee member in Pennsylvania. 'There was a choice: The only person that ever beat Trump, or a gigantic unknown.' Write to Philip Elliott at philip.elliott@time.com and Charlotte
