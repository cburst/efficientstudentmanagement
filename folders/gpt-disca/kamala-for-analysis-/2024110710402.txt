cautious, too poll-driven, too mercenary. There's too much advice in her head, and no one really knows who she is or what she wants. These limitations are things that are useful to expose in a yearlong presidential primary. There was some thinking, after the Democrats' summer-candidate switcheroo, when Harris was riding high, that eschewing a messy primary altogether might be a model for the parties going forward, to the extent they could get away with it. Even if the Democrats' 2024 circumstances were replicable, which they aren't, I'd say that argument has been resoundingly rebuked. Harris may not have won a full-year primary against the best candidates the Democratic Party had to offer-or she might have, because she could've gotten sharper during that process. Democrats might have gotten sharper during that process. But that's a process Democrats didn't allow themselves to have because, despite a deafening chorus from the public that Biden shouldn't run for a second term, he did. Biden was certain to lose, and the most that replacing him with Harris atop the ticket did was give Democrats a chance. It was a Hail Mary. Despite what you may be seeing of late, those usually don't work. Democrats will spend the next years figuring out what went wrong and how to rebuild. We all eagerly await this tedious process. Want to know a little secret, though? They probably won't change much, and they may get away with it. Trump will make a mess of himself once he's back in office, and the (probably) unified Republican Congress will spend capital on slashing Medicaid and cutting taxes for rich people, setting Democrats up for improvement in the midterms. Democrats will have an open primary with star governors in 2028, and Republicans will nominate someone who won't have that special something Trump has in activating new voters. Since I started covering politics in 2007, I've seen the Republican Party declared dead (2008), the Republican Party declared dead (2016, after nominating Trump), the Democratic Party declared dead (2016, after Trump won), the Republican Party declared dead (2020), and now the Democratic Party declared dead (2024). Maybe this one will last. Probably not. But Democrats would do well to nominate someone who's capable of serving for eight years. And watch out for those pandemic-induced supply shocks.
