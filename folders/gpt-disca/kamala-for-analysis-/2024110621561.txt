Donald Trump has been declared the winner of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. After defeating Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump will serve a second term in the White House as the 47th President of the United States. While Trump gave his acceptance speech early Wednesday morning, we are still awaiting a concession speech from Harris. How can you watch the speeches, and why are they so important? Here's what you need to know. A counterpart to Trump's victory speech, Kamala Harris is expected to give a concession speech later today. While not a legal requirement, the concession speech has long been a tradition in American democracy, often signals a peaceful transition of power and offers clarity to supporters once the electoral votes are counted. The voluntary gesture is also considered a graceful tradition of American democracy. Just after winning three critical battleground states - North Carolina, Georgia and Pennsylvania - victor Donald Trump addressed the crowd gathered at the Palm Beach County Convention Center at 2:30 a.m. ET. He surpassed the 270 electoral votes needed for re-election at 5:34 a.m. ET Wednesday. During the 25-minute speech, Trump said the campaign 'overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible,' alluding to two assassination attempts while campaigning during the summer. - USA TODAY contributed to this report.

The vice president addressed the nation from her alma mater, Howard University. Vice President Kamala Harris said her heart is 'full of resolve' after losing the presidential election to former President Donald Trump. 'My heart is full today -- full of gratitude for the trust you have placed in me, full of love for our country, and full of resolve,' Harris said Wednesday at her alma mater, Howard University, in Washington, D.C. 'The outcome of this election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for. But ... the light of America's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up,' Harris said. WATCH: Kamala Harris' full concession speech Harris said she told Trump on the phone Wednesday that she'll help with a peaceful transfer of power, which got a cheer from the crowd at Howard. 'We must accept the results of this election,' she said. Harris stressed, 'While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign.' 'The fight for freedom, for opportunity, for fairness and the dignity of all people -- a fight for the ideals at the heart of our nation -- the ideals that reflect America at our best,' she said. Harris vowed that she'll 'never give up the fight for a future ... where the women of America have the freedom to make decisions about their own body.' 'We will never give up the fight to protect our schools and our streets from gun violence,' she continued. 'And America, we will never give up the fight for our democracy, for the rule of law, for equal justice, and for the sacred idea that every one of us, no matter who we are or where we start out, has certain fundamental rights and freedoms that must be respected and upheld.' She said that fight will continue not just out loud, but also 'in quieter ways.' 'In how we live our lives: by treating one another with kindness and respect, by looking in the face of a stranger and seeing a neighbor,' she said. 'By always using our strength to lift people up, to fight for the dignity that all people deserve.' To young Americans watching, the vice president said, 'It's OK to feel sad and disappointed. But please know, it's gonna be OK.' To her young supporters watching, the vice president said, 'It is OK to feel sad and disappointed, but please know it's gonna be OK.' 'Sometimes the fight takes a while. ... The important thing is don't ever give up,' she said. 'This is not a time to throw up our hands, this is a time to roll up our sleeves. This is a time to organize, to mobilize and to stay engaged for the sake of freedom and justice and the future that we all know we can build together,' she said. Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff waved to the crowd after her remarks as Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, looked on. Harris' defeat came as Trump won the swing states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Wisconsin overnight. Trump won another swing state, Michigan, on Wednesday. Trump's victory underscores just how deep voters' frustrations were surrounding inflation and immigration, Republicans' two top issues this election cycle as polls consistently showed Americans' unhappiness with how President Joe Biden handled them. Trump's return to the White House also suggests that Democrats were not motivated enough by the prospect of electing the first female president and that its base's fury over the Supreme Court's revocation of constitutional abortion protections has waned since 2022. Harris had an extremely hurried campaign, which began this summer when Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed his vice president.
