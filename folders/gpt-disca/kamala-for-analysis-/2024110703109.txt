'The outcome of this election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for,' Harris said. 'But hear me when I say, the light of America's promise will always burn bright, as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting.' Harris had planned to address an audience like this at Howard on election night and had hoped she would have a more upbeat message to deliver. Instead, when Harris took the stage at her alma mater, she looked out at a sea of America flags and notably forlorn faces. She was flanked by 30 American flags. Minnesota Gov.

Ahead of her walk on to Beyonce's 'Freedom,' a mix included Jeezy's 'My President,' which includes the lyric, 'My president is Black.' Arizona's biggest county, Maricopa, says it will update its vote count this evening, sometime around 8 p.m. EST. Trump leads Harris by more than 4 points with about 60% of the expected vote counted. The newest votes will be mailed ballots that arrived or were dropped off on Election Day or shortly before. It's not clear which candidate those will favor. Democrat Kamala Harris earned a statewide win in Maine, collecting a pair of electoral votes on Wednesday. Maine is one of two states that divide their electoral votes with two votes going to the statewide winner and one vote apiece to the winner of each congressional district. The last time a Republican won the statewide vote in Maine was in 1988, when Republican George W. Bush defeated Democrat Michael Dukakis. The Associated Press declared Harris the statewide winner at 4:23 p.m. EST. Harris' campaign chair acknowledged the Democrat's 'unfathomably painful' loss in a memo to staff, but told the operatives who worked for the vice president that 'the work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump Presidency starts now.' Jen O'Malley Dillon's memo to staff acknowledged the pain of the moment for Democrats but took a hopeful tone about the work these staffers have done. 'Losing is unfathomably painful. It is hard. This will take a long time to process,' she wrote. 'But the work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump Presidency starts now.' O'Malley Dillon said Harris 'isn't finished in this fight' and said the staffers who worked for the vice president are 'going to be leaders in this collective mission.' 'View this as the beginning, not the end' she concluded. 'It will be hard work. But as the boss says: hard work is good work.' Beyonce's 'Freedom' became a mainstay of Harris' presidential campaign,
