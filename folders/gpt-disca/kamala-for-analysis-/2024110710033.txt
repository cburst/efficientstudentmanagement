doubted her chances. She stayed a cheerleader for the administration even though some of its leaders spent the first half of her term undermining her to the point of rendering her invisible and ineffective. And she fired up a party whose leaders had only in July talked quietly about bypassing her to put a white man at the top of the ticket. Ms. Harris worked feverishly to introduce herself and sell her political vision to an angry and exhausted American public - even as she struggled to separate herself from Mr. Biden. She built a multiracial, bipartisan coalition of supporters and allies. And it wasn't enough. 'She ran a damn good race, and we voted for white nationalism,' said Melanie L. Campbell, the chair of the Power of the Ballot Action Fund, an advocacy group focused on policies for Black Americans, who served on a committee of women who advised Mr. Biden in choosing Ms. Harris as his running mate. 'This level of vote was not because they were worried about grocery prices,' she said of American voters. 'They were worried about white privilege, white status, and sent the message that a multiracial democracy is fine as long as they're at the top.' As Ms. Harris conceded, she tacitly acknowledged the challenge she had faced. 'Don't you ever listen when anyone tells you something is impossible because it has never been done before,' she said. There were some signs on Tuesday of political momentum for Black women down the ballot. Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware and Angela Alsobrooks, the Prince George's County executive in Maryland, both won their races for Senate, giving the chamber two Black women for the first time - a long-sought goal for Black Democrats. But for Black women in the party, the defeat of Ms. Harris will sting for a long time. 'The vice president said from the very beginning that she was going to be running this race as an underdog, when you have 107 days versus somebody who's been running for nine years,' Senator Laphonza Butler of California, a close adviser to Ms. Harris, said on Tuesday night as the vice president's prospects dimmed. Citing the hundreds of Black women who were running in races across the country, Ms. Butler said that even if Ms. Harris lost, she would have proved to the Democratic Party and to the country that not only were Black women the beating heart of the party, 'but we are ready to take our seat at the table.' 'The country better be ready for the future of Black women who are going to continue to show up and demand their seat,' she said. Erica L.
