Harris wrote an exclusive letter to The Hilltop. 'At Howard, we learn that we have the capacity to be great and also that we have the responsibility to work hard to live up to that potential each day,' Harris wrote to Howardites. 'We know more needs to be done, and we look forward to continuing to work alongside you as we build a brighter future for all.' As Harris eyed American history as the first Black woman and South Asian woman to become president, the first president to hail from an HBCU, she returned to Alma Mater to begin a new chapter. The Harris-Walz campaign decided on The Yard as their final stop of relentless campaigning to convince voters that Harris, once a Bison with just a vision and self-belief , could etch a new chapter of American history. 'The first office I ever ran for was freshman class representative at Howard University,' Harris told V-103 Radio Station the morning of the election. 'To go back tonight to Howard, my beloved alma mater, and be able to hopefully...recognize this day for what it is, it's full circle for me.' An age-old mantra says that Black people have to be twice as good to get half as far. At no time was that adage on fuller display than during the 2024 presidential cycle, when Harris was called upon to stand up a presidential campaign in the shortest amount of time any major party candidate has ever attempted. But Harris proved she was up to this task, and she and other Bison will continue to elevate humanity through their extraordinary competence and commitment. She put it best in her 2017 Commencement speech. 'Because you are a Howard graduate, the bar is high,' she said, 'Which means you must be on the front line. You must be the first to raise your hand. You must be at the front of the line. You must lead. The bar can sometimes feel so high. It takes so much time and effort to reach it. So much sweat and so many tears. Being human, we sometimes fall short. That is ok. Because you went to Howard University, you have a responsibility to keep reaching for that bar and keep serving.'
