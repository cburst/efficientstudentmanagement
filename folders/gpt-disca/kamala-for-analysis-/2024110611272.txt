to dismiss and denigrate Harris. 'The way that Trump has painted her and people's responses to her have just brought out the worst in a lot of folks.' Andra Gillespie, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta, noted that Harris is not the first presidential candidate to encounter hurdles based on race or gender. She pointed to former President Barack Obama, the first Black president of the US, who faced repeated questions about his country of birth and whether he was Muslim. And then there was Clinton, the first female presidential nominee from a major party. During her campaign, Trump supporters rallied under signs that read, 'Trump that b****'. Trump himself accused her of 'playing the woman's card'. While Obama faced challenges with race and Clinton with gender, those hurdles were compounded for Harris, Gillespie told Al Jazeera, adding that the 'sexism that Harris faced is racially tinged'. 'All three of them, because of the ways that they were different, experienced challenges,' Gillespie said of Harris, Clinton and Obama. But Gillespie argued it was 'doubly hard for Harris' because of the combined force of misogyny and racism. 'Harris experienced them differently because she is both a woman and a person of colour.' But Harris's loss does not solely come down to questions of race and gender. Several analysts said the Democratic Party will have to grapple with how effectively it was able to connect with key demographics during this presidential race, including those disenchanted by Harris's stance on Israel's war in Gaza. The war had splintered the party in the lead-up to the election, with progressives, Arab Americans and Muslim voters largely opposing the Biden-Harris administration's continued support of Israel. Dalia Mogahed, a former research director at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, had warned that Harris's pro-Israel stance had the potential of costing her the election. But she emphasised it would be unfair to blame specific demographics for Harris's loss. 'It's the candidate that should be earning people's votes, not feeling entitled to them,' Mogahed said. Still, she feared that the tendency to assign blame may crop up now that Harris has been defeated. When Trump was first elected in 2016, there was a lot of 'liberal sympathy' for Muslim and Arab people who were seen as victims of his policies, Mogahed said. Trump implemented what critics called a 'Muslim ban' in 2017, restricting entry from seven Muslim-majority countries. But given the large Arab American and Muslim backlash to Harris's support for Israel, that same sympathy might not be present this time around, Mogahed warned. 'Muslims might feel very isolated in a second Trump presidency,' she said. 'And it's going to be a very difficult four years for anyone who is advocating on behalf of the humanity of Palestinians.' For Rasha Mubarak, a Palestinian American community organiser from Florida, Harris's defeat highlights the Democratic Party's failures to connect with key elements of its base. 'The Democratic Party continues to fail in listening to their voters,' Mubarak said, citing the party's support for Israel as well as its lack of engagement with under-resourced communities. She pointed out that, while Trump also boasts pro-Israel policies, Democrats like Harris had an opportunity to take action to alleviate the humanitarian concerns raised by Israel's war. But they did not. 'They had the power to place an arms embargo but instead chose to continue to fund and endorse Israel's genocide, and now it is the people in this country
