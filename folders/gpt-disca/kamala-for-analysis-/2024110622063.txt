stopped trying to reach, said WFP's Mitchell. 'It isn't necessarily drifting to the right in the way that some political pundits talk about it. Our approach is to take seriously meeting working-class people where they're at.' The working class is incredibly diverse, but a core set of issues unifies working people across ideology, Mitchell said. Three Working Families Party candidates flipped House seats in New York, where Democratic losses in the 2022 cycle cost the party the House. John Avlon and former Rep. Mondaire Jones, both Democratic candidates in New York who pivoted to the center, lost in swing districts. Rep. Pat Ryan, D-N.Y., faced an AIPAC-backed Republican challenger in the Catskills and the mid-Hudson Valley. Ryan campaigned alongside progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., in October. He won by 1 percentage point. 'Basically, it's class war, right? There's a reason why Democrats sometimes talk about taxing billionaires. Because it's hugely popular. We just think they need to say that a lot more,' Mitchell said. 'This group of working-class voters of all races that have either dropped out of politics in general and are hugely skeptical of politics, or are looking for other politics and are finding populist politics, and sometimes that brings them to the populist right.' In a statement on Wednesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-V.T., blamed Harris's loss on the party's neglect of working-class voters. 'It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working people would find that the working class has abandoned them. First, it was the white working class, and now it is Latino and Black workers as well,' Sanders said. 'Will the big money interests and well-paid consultants who control the Democratic Party learn any real lessons from this disastrous campaign? Will they understand the pain and political alienation that tens of millions of Americans are experiencing? Do they have any ideas as to how we can take on the increasingly powerful Oligarchy which has so much economic and political power? Probably not.' It's unsurprising to see bumps in minority support for Trump, Mitchell explained. 'When Black people are showing up for Democrats, it isn't unbridled support and unquestioning support for a political party. It's a strategic move,' he said. 'I want more Black voters asking questions and the political parties recognizing that there's a larger and larger component of the Black electorate that is persuadable.' The trends themselves aren't disturbing, Mitchell said. 'How you respond to those trends, I think, is critical. So if the Democratic Party doesn't take those trends seriously, then I think they would be in trouble. We're taking them seriously.' The End of Roe Jessica Washington This pattern held true in both red states and blue states, and even in states where efforts to protect abortion rights did not pass.
