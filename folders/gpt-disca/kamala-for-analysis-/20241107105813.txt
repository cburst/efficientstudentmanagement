former President Trump. Baldwin will now serve a third term in the upper chamber after first being elected in 2012. The race in Wisconsin was considered particularly competitive given the expectation that the state would also be decisive in the presidential election. With the steep decline in split-ticket voting, a Senate candidate would have a much greater chance at winning if the presidential candidate also took the state. The Fox News Power Rankings rated Wisconsin as a toss up in the presidential election as of mid-October. In late September, the Senate race was rated 'Leans Democrat.' Top political handicapper, the Cook Political Report, had similarly long held that the Wisconsin Senate race was in the 'Lean Democrat' category, but last month shifted its rating to a 'Toss up,' citing a closing polling gap between the candidates. A smiling Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., congratulated both President-elect Trump for his projected win and his fellow Senate Republicans for being projected to retake the majority in the new Congress. He told reporters on Wednesday, it is 'certainly a happy day for the GOP.' McConnell addressed the significance of the projected Trump win, remarking, 'What he's accomplished has not been done, as all of you know, since Grover Cleveland, which was a while back.' Former President Grover Cleveland was notably the only president to serve non-consecutive terms. 'I also want to commend the Trump campaign for running a sharper operation this time,' he added. Harris campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon sent a letter to all campaign staff on Wednesday, Fox News Digital has learned. The email stated: 'Just a few moments ago, the Vice President connected with President Trump to concede the race. In the call, she told him that she would work with President Biden to ensure a peaceful transfer of power, unlike what we saw in 2020. She also made clear that she hopes he will be a President for all Americans. I don't have words to express the gratitude I have for everyone getting this email. You left everything on the field. You built a first-rate, historic Presidential campaign in basically 90 days. You navigated things that no one has ever had to navigate, and likely no one will ever have to again. You stared down unprecedented headwinds and obstacles that were largely out of our control. We knew this would be a margin of error race, and it was. And, your work mattered: the whole country moved to the right, but compared to the rest of the country, the battleground states saw the least amount of movement in his direction. It was closest in the places we competed. That speaks to both the work you did, and the scale of the challenge we ultimately couldn't surmount.The Vice President will speak to the nation later today at Howard University. Immediately following the Vice President's speech, she and Governor Walz will host an all staff call to speak directly to you about what we accomplished in this short run and the road ahead for all of us. We hope you'll join us and we'll have a calendar invite shortly. I'll leave you with this: losing is unfathomably painful. It is hard. This will take a long time to process. But the work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump Presidency starts now. I know the Vice President isn't finished in this fight, and I know the very people on this email are also going to be leaders in this collective mission. View this as the beginning, not the end. It will be hard work. But as the boss says: hard work is good work. And I look forward to standing beside you.' A senior
