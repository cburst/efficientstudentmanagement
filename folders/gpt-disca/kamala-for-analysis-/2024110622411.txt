Menu Giving a concession speech before a crowd of supporters, Vice President Kamala Harris acknowledged the disappointment of losing a presidential election but encouraged supporters to keep hope for their future alive. 'The outcome of this election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for,' Harris told supporters at her alma mater Howard University on Wednesday. 'But hear me when I say the light of America's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting. Harris said she reached out to Trump to congratulate him on his electoral win, while also informing him that 'we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power.' RELATED STORY | Donald Trump projected to win presidential election, beating VP Kamala Harris The message is in stark contrast to how the 2020 presidential election ended. Trump refused to acknowledge his defeat and did not greet Joe Biden before leaving the White House. 'A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results,' Harris said. 'That principle as much as any distinguishes democracy from monarchy or tyranny. And anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it.' Harris' presidential campaign came to an end just months after it started. She jumped to the top of the Democratic ticket after President Biden dropped out of the race in July. She had a few short months to reintroduce herself to the public, select a running mate and craft policies she planned to implement if she were to be elected president.

It reported raising $1 billion in a few short months. However, money alone wasn't enough to propel Harris to victory. Trump's message about improving the economy and cracking down on illegal immigration appeared to resonate with voters. By early Wednesday morning, it was clear Trump would become the 47th president of the United States. Supporters of the vice president told Scripps News on Wednesday that Harris did everything she could, but didn't have enough time to make her case. Others felt race and misogyny played a role in the vice president's defeat. Harris, meanwhile, did not point any fingers. Instead, she encouraged her supporters to continue fighting for issues that impact their lives. 'America, we will never give up the fight for our democracy, for the rule of law, for equal justice and for the sacred idea that every one of us, no matter who we are or where we start out, has certain fundamental rights and freedoms that must be respected and upheld,' Harris said.
