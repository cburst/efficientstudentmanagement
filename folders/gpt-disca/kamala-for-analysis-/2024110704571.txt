We're following the latest election results in D.C., Maryland and Virginia, plus former President Donald Trump's win. Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to speak to supporters at Howard University at 4 p.m. Wednesday. Follow live updates below. Former President Donald Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in the race to the White House, NBC News projects. He claimed victory after winning Wisconsin, boosting him to 276 electoral votes. Trump's victory makes him the first incoming president to have been indicted and convicted of felony charges, after his hush-money trial in New York. He will gain the power to end other federal investigations pending against him. Trump also becomes only the second president in history to win non-consecutive White House terms, after Grover Cleveland in the late-19th century. In this second term, Trump will be America's 47th president. Democrat Eugene Vindman won Virginia's most competitive congressional race Wednesday, defeating his opponent in a blow to the GOP's hopes of flipping the open House seat, the Associated Press reports. NBC News has yet to project a winner in the race. In Virginia's 7th District, Vindman defeated Republican Derrick Anderson by a close margin after conservatives targeted the House seat. Democratic U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the district's three-term incumbent, decided to run for governor in 2025 - presenting an opening in the battleground district. Vindman, despite being a political newcomer, developed a national profile after blowing the whistle alongside his brother during then-President Donald Trump's first impeachment. The former Army officer focused his campaign on abortion rights and the threat of MAGA extremism on democracy. Anderson, a fellow veteran and former Green Beret, pitched himself as the more affable candidate, and centered his campaign on the economy. The election between Vindman and Anderson quickly became one of the most competitive in the country, with Republicans hoping to make gains in districts in which they don't face an incumbent. The acrimonious race was filled with insults and barbs. Read Full Article Mayor Muriel Bowser's team has been bracing for a second Donald Trump term that makes good on the former president's threats to 'take over' D.C. While on the campaign trail, Trump threatened a federal takeover of D.C. Any president of the United States has enormous power when it comes to D.C. because it's not a state. The president can take over the police department and many of the powers the mayor and D.C. Council have. Trump made the District, whose residents are overwhelmingly Democrats, a target in his re-election campaign. 'We will take over the horribly run capital of our nation in Washington, D.C., and clean it up, renovate it and rebuild our capital city so there is no longer a nightmare of murder and crime,' Trump said while campaigning in Florida over the summer. 'But, rather, it will become the most beautiful capital anywhere in the world. Right now, if you leave Florida - let's go, darling. Let's look at the Jefferson Memorial, let's look at the Washington Monument. Let's go and look at some of the beautiful scenes, and you end up getting shot, mugged, raped.' During a separate campaign stop, Trump said: 'And we're going to take it away from the mayor. And, again, that doesn't make me popular there, but I have to say it.' D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has publicly commented for the first time on President-elect Donald Trump's win. In a statement, she said she'll support the transition process and continue to advance the
