transition planning. Shortly after Harris' concession speech, a series of Democratic lawmakers issued their first statements in response to the election results and promised to ensure a 'peaceful' transition for the incoming Republican administration. 'As deeply, deeply disappointed as I am by the results of the election, make no mistake: my Democratic colleagues and I - unlike many Republicans after the 2020 election - will uphold the will of the American people, fulfill our constitutional duty and do our part to ensure a peaceful transfer of power,' Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois said in a statement. Transition talks have not yet begun in earnest, according to a person with knowledge of the Trump campaign. Instead, the president-elect was busy taking calls from leaders, domestic and international, donors and key supporters. Transition discussions are expected to ramp up later in the week, as attention turns to naming an inaugural committee and formal transition team. The person was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Nevada resumed counting votes on Wednesday afternoon, adding almost 21,000 votes including 9,000 from Clark County. Trump's lead in the state is about 560,000 votes, and the race is too early to call. Clark, home to Las Vegas, has the greatest number of ballots left to be counted. Election officials in Clark plan for another update late Wednesday and to update daily at 11 p.m. EST through Saturday.
