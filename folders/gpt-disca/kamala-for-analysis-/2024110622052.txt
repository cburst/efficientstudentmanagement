Biden-Harris administration that has been unflinchingly supporting the Israeli assault on Gaza and Lebanon. He stressed that the election is not the end of political engagement, saying that the community will press Trump to deliver on his promise of bringing peace to the region. 'It doesn't stop here,' Alfarjalla told Al Jazeera. 'We have to work more to make sure our issues are heard - to stop the genocide in Gaza, stop the invasion of south Lebanon, and let Palestine have its own state. We're hopeful about that. That's our number one priority for this community.' He also said that Harris supporters' 'lesser of two evils' pitch to the community backfired because many voters could not see a worse evil than the administration providing the bombs that were killing their families and destroying their hometowns. While both major candidates back Israel, the Harris campaign committed a series of unforced errors that further alienated the community in Michigan and beyond, Arab American advocates told Al Jazeera. At the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August, the Harris campaign rejected demands to allow a speech by a Palestinian speaker. The Democratic candidate also turned down a request for a meeting by the Uncommitted Movement, which was founded during the Democratic Primary process to pressure Biden over his unconditional support for Israel. Unlike Trump, Harris did not visit Dearborn, the de-facto seat of Arab American political and financial power, during her campaign. Instead, Harris met with handpicked Arab and Muslim 'leaders' in Flint, about an hour north of Detroit, last month. Moreover, Harris campaigned with Liz Cheney in Michigan and welcomed the endorsement of her father, former President Dick Cheney - an architect of the so-called 'War on Terror' that devastated the Middle East. Numerous Arab American activists invoked Harris's embrace of the Cheneys when underscoring her apparent disregard for their communities. 'We had Harris endorsed by neoconservatives like Liz Cheney and Dick Cheney, and she's openly campaigning with them and talking about how great they are,' Dearborn councilman Mustapha Hammoud told Al Jazeera on Tuesday night as the results trickled in. 'You know what? I don't think people are willing to vote for George W Bush, so you weren't going to see people vote for Harris, either.' Speaking under a Harris campaign sign last week, former President Bill Clinton claimed that Hamas 'forces' Israel to kill Palestinian civilians and suggested that Zionism pre-dates Islam. The campaign's behaviour led some advocates to question whether the Democratic candidate has given up on the Arab community. 'Vice President Harris has shown over and over again that she actually doesn't want our vote,' Uncommitted Movement leader Layla Elabed told Al Jazeera last week. Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud also noted that the Harris campaign was hesitant to engage Arab Americans directly. 'They don't want the heckling to occur. They don't want to knock on the doors where they think the conversations are going to drag, and the votes might not be there,' the mayor told Al Jazeera before the elections. On the policy front, Harris did not make any concrete promises to the community - even within the acceptable realm of mainstream politics - like reopening the Palestinian diplomatic mission in Washington, DC, or resuming funding for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA). In contrast, Biden released platforms for Arab and Muslim Americans in 2020, promising domestic and foreign policy moves sought by the community - many
