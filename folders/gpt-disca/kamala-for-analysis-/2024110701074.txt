'presidential transition project' created by the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation, could draw intense interest when the Trump administration takes power in January. Harris attempted to tie the former president to the 900-page document that outlines extreme policy positions, such as limiting abortion access and mass deportation, that project supporters hope Trump will implement. Trump has repeatedly distanced himself from the project, claiming in a July Truth Social post to 'know nothing about Project 2025' despite many of the project's creators having close ties to the previous Trump administration. Cybele Mayes-Osterman and Sam Woodward Harris will address supporters at Howard University in Washington, tentatively at 4 p.m. ET, a source familiar with the plans confirmed. She is expected to formally concede the race. Harris had been set to publicly address her followers at an election night party at Howard, her alma mater, but the vice president stayed at her residence as her path to victory narrowed. Trump secured the 270 electoral votes needed to become the next president after he was projected the winner of Wisconsin around 5:40 a.m. ET. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Wednesday that the narrowly divided House appears set to remain in Republican control, which he credited to widespread support for secure borders and reducing inflation. The House will participate in a unified GOP government with the Senate and White House after victories in critical swing districts in Michigan and Pennsylvania, Johnson said. 'The latest data and trends indicate that when all the votes are tabulated, Republicans will have held our majority, even though we faced a map with 18 Biden-won seats,' Johnson said in a statement. 'I look forward to working with President Trump and a Republican Senate to deliver as speaker of the House on the mandate entrusted to us by the American people.' Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Wednesday that he plans to clear out 'entire departments' at the Food and Drug Administration if he has the capacity to do so in the next Trump administration. 'I can get the corruption out of the agencies,' Kennedy said in an interview with MSNBC. 'That's what I've been doing for 40 years. I've sued all those agencies. I have a Ph.D. in corporate corruption.' The president-elect thanked Kennedy, who suspended his independent presidential campaign to endorse Trump, during his victory speech. Last week, Kennedy said Trump 'promised' him control of U.S. health agencies, but a member of the Trump transition team refuted that. 'He's going to help make America healthy again,' Trump said about Kennedy early Wednesday morning. 'He wants to do some things, and we're gonna let him go to it.' Rachel Barber Jeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon and owner of The Washington Post, congratulated president-elect Trump on his victory over Harris on Wednesday. 'Big congratulations to our 45th and now 47th President on an extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory. No nation has bigger opportunities' Bezos wrote in a post on X Wednesday morning. 'Wishing @realDonaldTrump all success in leading and uniting the America we all love.' The good wishes come a week after Bezos defended the Post's decision not to issue an endorsement of either presidential candidate - a move that broke with decades of tradition and led to resignations of multiple members of the editorial board as well as the cancellation of over 200,000 digital subscriptions, NPR reported. The editorial board had intended to endorse Harris before Bezos made the
