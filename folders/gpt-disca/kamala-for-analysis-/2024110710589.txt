During a speech in Grand Rapids, Michigan, this week, Trump described Pelosi as something that 'starts with a B.' 'She's an evil, sick, crazy.,' the Republican candidate said, stopping short. 'It starts with a B, but I won't say it. I wanna say it.' Pelosi has returned the jabs back to Trump in the past, and recently claimed that he was suffering from 'cognitive degeneration' during a recent appearance on MSNBC.

Tim Walz, who both 'ran a remarkable campaign,' in a Wednesday statement. 'This is obviously not the outcome we had hoped for, given our disagreements with the Republican ticket on a whole host of issues,' Obama said in a joint statement with his wife, Michelle Obama. 'But living in a democracy is about recognizing that one point of view won't always win out, and being willing to accept the peaceful transfer of power.' Issues like the COVID-19 pandemic and economic struggles for voters created 'headwinds for Democratic incumbents in recent years,' Obama said. 'And last night showed that America is not immune,' he said. 'In a country as big as ours, we won't always see eye-to-eye on everything,' he added. 'But progress requires us to extend good faith and grace - even to people with whom we deeply disagree.'

Her address came hours after calling President-elect Donald Trump to concede earlier today. The delayed timing echoes former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's concession in 2016, who also waited until the next day to deliver her concession. Harris walked out to the podium wearing a black pantsuit, with the crowd cheering as Beyonce's 'Freedom' played in the background. 'My heart is full today, full of gratitude,' opened Harris.Harris thanked President Biden, her family, and the Walz family before thanking her supporters and volunteers. 'I am so proud of the race we ran and the way we ran it.' 'Now I know folks are feeling and experiencing a range of emotions right now, I get it. But we must accept the results of this election.' Harris then mentioned calling President-elect Trump to concede the race, and the crowd audibly booed. Harris also said that she will accept the results of the election and will certify the results on January 6, but added loyalty must be to the Constitution first and foremost. 'While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign: the fight for freedom, for opportunity, for fairness, for the dignity of all people.' Harris reiterated her positions on guns and
