overnight. She delivered a taste of that 2008 Obama feeling-hope. An endless amount of hope. I matched my wife and daughter on energy and bought in. When Obama was elected, I was naive about political power. I believed that his election would erase racism and force oppressors to see the errors of their ways. I foolishly thought his acceptance meant we were all being accepted, but that could not have been farther from the truth. The country accepted him, but not us. He was special. We were exactly the same. He experienced a revolution in his own home, life and legacy that we celebrate from the same places of uncertainty where we remain. That's the feeling I walked away with as a man. I can only imagine how Black women, who have to deal with double oppression, felt. I can only imagine how Black women, who have to deal with double oppression, felt. I was equally naive after Trump's first term, thinking his presidency would cause our country to collapse. Even though his mismanagement of COVID and hateful, divisive rhetoric left us eternally scarred, we are still here. We made it. Hopefully, my wife and I can show our daughter that she will make it to. Eight years of President Obama and four years of Trump have taught me that the goals I expected from my leader had to be realistic, not some dreamy left-wing utopia full of reparations, and universal freedom or instant destruction, as a result of chaotic racism. No leader will ever be too bad or too good. The only thing guaranteed is that we have to show up and fight. We will rally, we will vote and we will continue to champion women as a family. I don't want to lose this special moment by becoming lost in the reality of surviving Trump. Kamala Harris was elected Vice President. That is proof we are moving in the right direction, even as we prepare to navigate this setback. Her journey and leadership will continue to inspire my family as we prepare for whatever is next. And until we figure out what that is, we will be fighting - for you, for us and for America. Read more about 2024 elections D. Watkins is an Editor at Large for Salon.
