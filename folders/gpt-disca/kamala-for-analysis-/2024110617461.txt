OpinionTressie McMillan Cottom Credit...Damon Winter/The New York Times Supported by By Tressie McMillan Cottom Opinion Columnist I have always been audacious about Black women's political aspirations. When I was 15 years old I decided to become a local pageant queen, a Carousel Princess, for our Thanksgiving Parade. It was an uncharacteristic choice. I was an oratory and student government kind of girl. I don't remember much about the pageant except the question portion, in which I was asked, 'What do you want to be in the future?' I intended to be 'the first Black female Supreme Court justice.' The emcee smiled indulgently. I stared defiantly. Some 30 years later, Ketanji Brown Jackson took my Supreme Court justice job. And this week Vice President Kamala Harris almost became the first Black female president. Our policy differences aside, her ascendancy to the top of her party should have felt like the realization of my childhood dreams. Instead, for weeks I have felt isolated in my ennui. As it turns out, Donald Trump was harder to vanquish than so many of us hoped. He won. And today it feels like his brand of identity politics is more audacious than my youthful dreams about a Black female president. The Monday night before Election Day, I drove to my nearby alma mater, North Carolina Central University, with an anxiety headache. In the words of Alice Walker, I went searching for my mother's garden - a connection to the ancestral continuation of Black women's survival and resilience. The campus has a polling place, perhaps in part because I helped organize one my sophomore year in college. It is where I cast my first vote for president. This historically Black college campus in Durham, N.C. - a Southern city that once had a 'Black Wall Street' - is full of the ghosts of voter suppression and dogged Black resilience. It is also home to the ghost of my young, ambitious, audacious self. As I walked across campus, I thought about the prospect of a Harris victory and wondered why I wasn't more excited about the possibility of our first Black female president. Kamala Harris embodies audacity even more than Barack Obama once did. Like Obama, she is of mixed race and identifies as Black. But she is also the child of two immigrants, and she is unquestionably a product of Black American institutions. She is a graduate of Howard University. A member of the first intercollegiate Black sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha. An Oakland pedigree. And she has that silk press. Women of color were among the last minority groups to get the right to vote. The fact that someone who represents those who were last to be included in American democracy came so close to saving this nation from its worst impulses is audacious, by any measure. There will be a lot of accounting of why Harris came so close but did not close the deal. I know two things today. I know the fundamentals of how and why Trump exists - I've written about them too many times to count - and I know that nothing about those fundamentals has changed. I knew that a month ago. I knew it a week ago. I didn't want to know it again today. But this election was about enthusiasm and diagnoses. The long-term trajectory of our country has not changed. Millions of middle-class people feel working-class. These Americans have no way to describe what is happening to them. Is it the borders? Is it supposedly dangerous cities? The loss of God in the classroom? Cultural Marxism? Wokeism? Inflation? Tariffs? Women? Nature abhors a vacuum. But political opportunists thrive in vacuums. This election was about who told
