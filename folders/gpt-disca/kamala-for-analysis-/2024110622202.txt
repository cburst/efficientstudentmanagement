Trump to congratulate him on his win and discussed the 'importance of a peaceful transfer of power and being a president for all Americans,' a senior aide to Harris said. The vice president, in her role as president of the Senate, will preside over Congress' counting of electoral votes during a joint session on Jan. 6 that will reaffirm Trump's victory. Steven Cheung, spokesman for the Trump campaign, said that during the call, the president-elect 'acknowledged Vice President Harris on her strength, professionalism, and tenacity throughout the campaign, and both leaders agreed on the importance of unifying the country.' Mr. Biden also spoke with Harris by phone and congratulated her on a 'historic campaign,' the White House said. He also talked to Trump and 'expressed his commitment to ensuring a smooth transition and emphasized the importance of working to bring the country together.' Harris was expected to address supporters from Howard, the historically Black college where she graduated in 1986, on election night, but never made it to her alma mater as the results came rolling in. Instead, campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond sent the assembled crowd home and said Harris would speak on Wednesday. Election Day on Nov. 5 capped a chaotic and historic presidential election cycle that saw two assassination attempts against Trump and was roiled by Mr. Biden's sudden announcement in July that he would exit the race following a disastrous debate performance in late June. Harris swiftly announced her own candidacy for the White House, and Democrats quickly coalesced around her as their pick to take on Trump. Her nomination was solidified at the Democratic National Committee in Chicago in August, where Harris made history as the first woman of color to top a major party ticket.
