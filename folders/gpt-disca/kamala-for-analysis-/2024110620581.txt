Vice President Kamala Harris delivered her concession speech at Howard University, following her loss to Republican opponent Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Oh, yes, like bye bye. Ok, sorry friends then get back to bed. Yes. Oh bye. We are. Yeah. And when I wake up, I reckon she let me for the pay cut. We make a living skim it. So my, ok, that when I was looking at the world like where do we go? And we hate po po when they kill us. Dared in the street was so I'm at the pre door, my knees. Oh, what do you want to a house? Yeah, you can live with the number one I, I don't think to the public and this I assured my even up and down when I was looking at the world like where do we go? And we hate pork, pork when they kill us. So I'm at the peak. Just go. My knee is getting weak in my curve. Be all hours later and I have some of my prayers don the MA S MA to go. But you know you, I like it. Shut up. You know you make me go. No 1000. I still read how you out this house. So I PJ. Oh I'm fire shall be no competition. No, no. One our president for president of Blank greed and my why? Thanks. Tell me I just, yeah, please welcome the vice president of the United States. No, the good afternoon, the... good afternoon, everyone. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So let me say and I love you back and I love you back. So let me say my heart is full today. My heart is full today, full of gratitude for the trust you have placed in me, full of love for our country and full of resolve.

But hear me when I say, hear me, when I say the light of America's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up. And as long as we keep fighting to my beloved Doug and our family, I love you so very much to President Biden and Dr Biden. Thank you for your faith and support to governor, walls and the walls, family. I know your service to our nation will continue and to my extraordinary team to the volunteers who gave so much of themselves to the poll workers and the local election officials. I thank you. I thank you all. Look, I am so proud of the race we ran and the way we ran it and the way we ran it over the 107 days of this campaign. We have been intentional about building community and building coalitions, bringing people together from every walk of life and background, united by love of country with enthusiasm and joy in our fight for America's future. And we did it with the knowledge that we all have so much more in common than what separates us. Now. I know folks are feeling and experiencing a range of emotions right now. I get it, but we must accept the results of this election. Earlier today, I spoke with President elect Trump and congratulated him on his victory. I also told him that we will help him and his team with their transition and that we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power. A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results. That principle as much as any other, distinguishes democracy from monarchy or tyranny. And anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it. At the same time in our nation. We owe loyalty not to a president or a party, but to the constitution of the United States and loyalty to our conscience and to our
