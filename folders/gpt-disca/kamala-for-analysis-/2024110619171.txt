Vice President Kamala Harris, who called and congratulated President-elect Donald Trump on his victory in the 2024 presidential election, is expected to make a speech Wednesday afternoon from Howard University in Washington, D.C. The Democratic presidential nominee will deliver the speech at 4 p.m. ET, the White House confirmed. Harris had been expected to address her election night party Tuesday night at the historically Black college where she was an undergraduate. However, as voting results came in, it became clear early Wednesday morning Trump would ultimately win a second term in the White House. Polls prior to Election Day showed Harris and Trump in a neck-and-neck race. But former President Donald Trump prevailed in a decisive victory, winning all seven battleground states - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - that for weeks had been considered considered a tossup. Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July following a poor performance against former President Donald Trump in a June 27 presidential debate.

During her three-month campaign, Harris faced the challenges of an unpopular President Joe Biden, whose disapproval ratings in exit polls Tuesday rated about 41%. The Harris campaign and Democratic party fundraising committees set fundraising records including raising more than $1 billion since Harris became the nominee. Many billionaires including Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg also supported Harris. (Elon Musk was among those who supported Trump.)
