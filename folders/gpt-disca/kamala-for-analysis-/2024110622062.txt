a functioning democracy.' O'Rourke is one of two Working Families Party members on the city council. Local Democrats fought tooth and nail against the WFP, but the group's wins ousted Republicans from the council in the heavily blue city for the first time in history with O'Rourke's 2023 win. He said the focus on whether Black men had strayed from the Harris campaign missed the larger reason for demographic shifts. 'The issue that I found, more often than not, was not an interest in Trump, it was a lack of interest in engagement. And that has been true beyond just this election season and cycle,' O'Rourke said. 'I continue to believe that there is an opportunity to engage Black men. They feel forgotten, not seen. They don't see the value in voting - some of them, not all. . There's a lot to be said about engagement from the political parties actually connecting with Black men before you're expecting them to turn out.' 'That is something that every party should be paying attention to, whether it's election season or not, because a functioning democracy would care about that.' A few hours before Harris made her first stop in Reading, Trump held a rally with thousands of people at the city's downtown Santander Arena. While Trump made fewer stops in Pennsylvania than Harris - 22 to Harris's 26 - Republican groundwork targeting voters in Latino, Black, and white working-class neighborhoods allowed him to outperform Democrats, who put much of their focus into persuading affluent voters in blue strongholds. While Latino men and women supported Biden by 59 and 69 percent, exit polls from Tuesday show that 55 percent of Latino men voted for Trump. Latino women still overwhelmingly supported Harris, but by 6 percentage points less than they had in 2020. Latino voters in Reading are reachable - Democrats just haven't put in the work, Reading's first Latino mayor, Eddie Moran, told Politico Magazine earlier this month. Moran won his 2019 primary against a Democratic incumbent by doing one thing: talking to Latino voters in neighborhoods Democrats had forgotten. Democratic outreach to Latinos happened largely with the help of groups like Make the Road Action PA, which focuses on engaging Black and brown voters. The group knocked on more than 560,000 doors, made contact with 50,000 voters in eight counties, and had 413,000 conversations with Latino voters across the state. 'In Pennsylvania, the minimum wage hasn't gone up in 20+ years.' Issues like the cost of living and housing were prominent across those conversations, said Diana Robinson, co-deputy director of Make the Road Action Pennsylvania. 'The rent is too high, people are struggling to pay their bills. That is something we think is unifying to folks across the board,' she said. 'In Pennsylvania, the minimum wage hasn't gone up in 20+plus years.' Kandice Cabeza, a Harris voter in Northeast Philadelphia, said she came out to support the right to abortion but was not thrilled about either candidate. She's originally from Baltimore but has lived in Philadelphia for 10 years. 'What are you doing for the people? What's changing with the cost of living, food, medical assistance, and things like that, medical bills? All those things matter too,' Cabeza said. 'I really haven't heard much about that from neither one of them. They're kind of feuding over who's gonna be number one. But what about us? It's kind of like, fingers crossed that someone looks out for all of us and not just a certain group.'
