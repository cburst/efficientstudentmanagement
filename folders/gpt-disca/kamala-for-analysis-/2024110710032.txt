political persona after Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman elected to Congress, in 1968, and the first Black woman to run for a major party's presidential nomination, in 1972. Many of Ms. Chisholm's acolytes became Ms. Harris's advisers and closest confidants during her second presidential campaign. But even Ms. Chisholm predicted a slow walk to progress. That was, in part, because of the intense sexism that she faced from men of all races, who believed that her campaign was too tailored to issues favoring women, people of color and the poor. 'This 'woman thing' is so deep,' she said of her presidential run. 'I've found it out in this campaign, if I never knew it before.' 'That I am a national figure because I was the first person in 192 years to be at once a congressman, Black and a woman proves, I would think, that our society is not yet either just or free,' she wrote in her autobiography, 'Unbought and Unbossed.' Maya Wiley, the chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said there was deep anger about the license that Mr. Trump's victory had given to continue to undercut Black women in politics, down to the derogatory ways he and his allies have described female leaders. Presidential Election Results Map: See how Donald Trump won. Red Shift Across the U.S.: Of the counties with nearly complete results, more than 90 percent shifted in favor of Trump. 10 Takeaways From Trump's Win: America's democracy will again be put to the test. Republicans Clinch Control of the Senate: Tight races in swing states will determine their margin. 'Not only have we always been on the menu, but they have been eating us, and it's been happening for generations,' Ms. Wiley said. 'And what this represents for Black women right now is it has deepened and been given significantly more permission.' Still, she added, 'it is not over, because we never go away.' Mr. Trump's overwhelming victory leaves Democrats with a lot of work to do. Nearly the entire country shifted sharply to the right as it returned him to power. Democrats watched as he won alarmingly high shares of the vote in blue states: 47 percent in Virginia and New Jersey. 44 percent in New York. 43 percent in Connecticut. The night represented a striking rebuke of a Democratic Party that has grown more aligned with college-educated, wealthier Americans, and struggled to maintain support from working-class voters and people of color. As the party picks up the pieces, preparing to oppose a second Trump administration and looking ahead to 2026 and 2028, Black women are likely to again play a central role. Long hailed as the backbone of the Democratic Party, they have supported liberal candidates in overwhelming numbers, organized political operations on the ground and fueled victory after victory. Yet Black women running for office have often said that the party is not investing adequately in their campaigns, particularly those for higher positions like Senate and governor (there has still never been a Black female governor). Some candidates have argued that this dearth in support has been the difference between winning and losing in close races. Ms. Harris had plenty of investment, hauling in more than $1 billion, but the circumstances of her candidacy were far from ideal. Overnight, she had to resuscitate a dying campaign and re-energize a despairing Democratic base that had fallen into despondency over Mr. Biden's poor debate performance and sinking political standing. She stayed fiercely loyal to a boss who had grown widely disliked, and who at times privately
