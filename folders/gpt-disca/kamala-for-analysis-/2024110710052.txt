implement them, and when voters disapprove of the outcome, those in charge more often than not simply move on to the next thing, hoping the discontent gets forgotten, or else wave away the criticism as a function of ignorance or disinformation. Turns out, that isn't very politically effective. On the contrary, it tends to lead the discontent to fester and develop into a virulent infection plaguing the body politic. Donald Trump is its foremost and most dangerous symptom. To put the problem in somewhat different terms: Ms. Harris ran for president as a conservative aiming to preserve, protect and defend the country's bipartisan political establishment against the anti-system furor that's been rising for many years in the electorate and that is fuel behind the MAGA movement. The problem is that there simply aren't enough voters in the mood to celebrate that establishment and its works. That poses a daunting problem for Democrats because, since the time of the New Deal nearly a century ago, the party has aimed to use the power of government to improve the lives of ordinary Americans. Since the 1990s, the impulse to find new ways to accomplish this goal has run up against potent, organized opposition, with the early ambitions of Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama met by resounding electoral repudiations in the midterm elections halfway through their first terms. But now skepticism, if not cynicism, about government goes beyond proposals to expand the size and scope of government. It extends to much of what the government already does, beyond automatic transfer payments and some forms of law enforcement. This doesn't mean Democrats need to pack it up and go home. Instead of proposing sweeping new programs or even taking a stand, as Ms. Harris did, in defense of the status quo, they could try to redefine themselves as responsible reformers. The first step in doing so would be to admit some of the mistakes public servants from both parties have made over the past two decades and express humility about them, along with the desire to learn from those errors. In some cases, this could yield promises to change or even halt some government work. Parts of what Ms. Harris proposed - reforms designed to increase the housing supply and lower housing costs; building on the Biden administration's efforts at permitting reform - were tentative steps in this direction. They paid few political dividends because they were isolated lines in stump speeches rather than integral parts (along with others) of the campaign's overarching vision of the country's future. Many Americans have lost their trust in government. Democrats need to be at the forefront of helping to earn back that trust. The first step toward doing so, like an effort to overcome an addiction, must be admitting there's a problem. If this week's painful drubbing at the polls has that effect on the party, it may well prove to have a salutary effect.
