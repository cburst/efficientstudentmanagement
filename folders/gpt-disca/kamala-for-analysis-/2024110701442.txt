trying to deliver services efficiently. I will name a task force to minimize waste and deliver results.' Take some of Elon's thunder. Who likes bureaucracy? Accept some of the grievances Americans have as being in good faith, and make yourself someone who redefines party orthodoxy to build a bigger tent. But to do these things it would take someone-either the candidate or the campaign manager-with a real vision. The candidate matters. If your candidate is a particular person with real strengths and weaknesses, you can't make them into a different person or swap them out (more than once). There were also issues with Harris inheriting Biden's team and campaign; there wasn't a multi-year arc of trust built up. I don't think the campaign team had confidence in Kamala to take on certain tasks. And instead of figuring out how to grow to a win, the strategy became trying to eke out a narrow win that eventually turned into a loss, despite a massive fundraising advantage. Tons of campaign time was spent on raising money for ads that never moved the needle. There's a lesson there too. Now the Democratic Party will say, 'It's okay, we'll come back in '28!' Consultants will burnish their resumes by throwing someone else under the bus. Profiles will be written about the next crop of candidates for what they hope will be the next election. Will they learn? Why would you imagine so after witnessing this year? Fundamentally, the party has become insular-more concerned about itself than the people and families it pretends to represent. Conformity ruled over courage or common sense. Enough Americans have lost faith to give the reins of power back to Donald Trump. No one should walk away from this thinking that the situation is tenable. The question should not be 'Who's next?' but instead 'What is next?' Everything, including a new political party that gets us beyond the tedious us vs. them, should be on the table. Andrew Yang is a businessman, lawyer, philanthropist, and former candidate for president of the United States. In July 2022, Yang, alongside Democrats, Republicans and Independents, launched the new Forward Party to give Americans more choice in our democracy.
