All the states adopted the measures by 2-1 margins or better. The constitutional amendments typically approved a very simple change of phrasing about citizens voting to add 'only' citizens may vote. North Carolina and Wisconsin were key swing states that each adopted constitutional amendments. Other states were Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Oklahoma and South Carolina. 'It is illegal for non-citizens to vote in our elections,' Michael Whatley, co-chairman of the Republican National Committee, said when filing lawsuits against states to prevent noncitizen voting. 'Yet time and again, we have seen Democrat officials oppose basic safeguards and dismantle election integrity provisions, intentionally opening the door to non-citizen voting in our elections.' Studies by the Brennan Center for Justice and the libertarian Cato Institute have found noncitizen voting is essentially nonexistent.
