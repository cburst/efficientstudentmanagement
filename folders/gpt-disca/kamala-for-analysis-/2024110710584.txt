we have been preparing for President Trump's next administration,' the statement said. 'In the days and weeks ahead, President Trump will be selecting personnel to serve our nation under his leadership and enact policies that make the life of Americans affordable, safe, and secure.' 'We are proud to volunteer our time to present President Trump with a wide array of experts from which he can select for his team,' they added. The statement said voters gave Trump a mandate 'that puts the working men and women of our nation first. As he chooses the best people to join his team and best policies to pursue, his transition team will ensure the implementation of President Trump's common sense agenda starting on Day 1.' Speaker of the House Mike Johnson shared his ambitions for the House of Representatives on the Ingraham Angle on Wednesday night after Republicans maintained their majority in Tuesday's elections. Johnson hopes to keep his seat as Speaker. His appearance on the show underscored a letter he shared with colleagues and the general public on proposed GOP policy goals for Congress. 'We can secure our borders, prioritize the needs of Americans above foreigners, promote investment and opportunity through the tax code, return to American energy dominance, dramatically reduce regulations, expand school choice, end the woke agenda, and restore fiscal sanity to Washington-among other pressing items,' read Speaker Johnson's letter. 'The American people have shown by their votes that they are ready to turn from the misery of the past four years and embark on a brighter, bolder path that is marked not by big government, bureaucratic control, poverty, inflation and wokeness-but by liberty, security, strength, prosperity and opportunity,' concluded the letter. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, also a Louisianan, threw his hat in the ring to keep his position as well. Governor Tim Walz, the running mate of Vice President Kamala Harris, took to the social media site X on Wednesday after Harris formally conceded, thanking her for the opportunity. 'Thank you Vice President @KamalaHarris for putting your faith in me, and selecting me as your running mate,' wrote Walz. 'Campaigning at your side was the honor and privilege of my life.' 'While the outcome is not what we wanted, I am grateful to the millions of Americans who joined our campaign and stood up for our greatest ideals: decency, compassion, and love of our neighbor. Now more than ever, we need you to continue fighting for those values and the country we all love,' his post concluded. Walz' post currently has over 14,000 likes. Ritchie Torres blamed progressive Democrats for President-elect Trump's win on Tuesday. (Getty Images) A Democratic congressman from New York recently blamed progressives for President-elect Trump's victory this week, arguing that far-left causes actually disenchant certain voters. Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., claimed that his party has 'alienated historic numbers' of minority voters in an X (former Twitter) post on Wednesday. Torres, a vocal supporter of Israel, pointed fingers at pro-Palestinian protests as one of the causes - as well as the movement to defend police. 'Donald Trump has no greater friend than the far left, which has managed to alienate historic numbers of Latinos, Blacks, Asians, and Jews from the Democratic Party with absurdities like 'Defund the Police' or 'From the River to the Sea' or 'Latinx,' Torres wrote. 'There is more to lose than there is to gain politically from pandering to a far left that is more representative of Twitter, Twitch,
