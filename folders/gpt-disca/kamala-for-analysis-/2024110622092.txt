Harris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to ascend as the nominee of a major political party. 'You have the capacity to do extraordinary good in the world. And so to everyone who is watching, do not despair. This is not a time to throw up our hands. This is a time to roll up our sleeves.' When she delivered her speech on Wednesday, Ms. Harris thanked Mr. Biden, who was watching from the West Wing, as well as her family and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota. Mr. Walz stood off to the side, grimacing and seeming on the verge of tears. Doug Emhoff, her husband, embraced their daughter, Ella. Ms. Harris also took a moment to address the young people watching. 'It is OK to feel sad and disappointed, but please know it's going to be OK,' she said. 'On the campaign, I would often say, 'When we fight, we win.' But here's the thing, here's the thing: Sometimes the fight takes a while. That doesn't mean we won't win.' The crowd of supporters gathered at Howard was far sparser than the one that had awaited her on Tuesday evening for her election night party, hoping to witness a historic victory. Jack Ludd, 79, had missed the watch party because he was tired after his fourth trip to Pennsylvania canvassing for the Harris campaign, but he showed up to hear Ms. Harris concede. Resting on the seat of his walker as he waited for the vice president, he said he felt 'afraid' about the prospect of four more years under Mr. Trump. 'I don't know what to expect,' said Mr. Ludd, a retired taxi driver from Washington. 'I depend on Social Security.' But he was not entirely surprised by her defeat. On his canvassing trips, Mr. Ludd said, 'the buses were almost empty.' Kadidra Hurst also traveled to Howard on Wednesday to show Ms. Harris her appreciation, although she knew that the crowd would not be as big as Tuesday's. 'I wanted Kamala to know that I still support her,' Ms. Hurst said. 'I think really, we need a message of, what do we do next? And I feel like she gave us that - that we continue to fight we, we keep our foot on the gas.' Her 5-year-old daughter, Tasmin Hurst, said it was 'very good' to see Ms. Harris onstage. She said she was sad about the loss, saying Mr. Trump was 'very not a nice man.' Adriane Lowrie was brought to tears as she talked about seeing Ms. Harris leave the stage one last time. 'All that she did to fight,' Ms. Lowrie said, wiping away tears. 'It's just sad, the state of our country is so divided.' The night before, thousands of people had gathered with high enthusiasm at Howard, watching CNN on giant outdoor screens. They cheered and waved American flags when good news came in for Ms. Harris, like her unsurprising victory in California. But when the results from the battleground states showed up, the crowd was largely silent as an anchor ticked through Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina - she trailed in all - only celebrating when her soon-to-evaporate lead in Michigan was announced. Later in the evening, the Harris campaign shut off the sound to the television screens and started playing music after a CNN guest remarked that the election felt 'more like 2016 than 2020.' Ms. Harris's sorority sisters, clad in the pink and green of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, streamed slowly out of the campus. One broke her prayer to decline to speak with a reporter. Just before Ms. Harris officially lost Georgia, the song she chose for her campaign, 'Freedom,' by Beyonce - an ode to the journey of liberation of Black women from slavery - began blaring through loudspeakers.
