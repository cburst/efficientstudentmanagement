She also advocated for stricter gun control legislation. The Harris and Biden Administration's record includes multi-dynamic initiatives in aspects of American work life, protection against climate change, and economic rebuild after the pandemic. 'There's no question that working people are paying more gas, more groceries and that is why for our administration it is one of our highest priorities to bring down the costs,' Harris told reporter Robert Costa during her Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan appearance on July 10, 2022. This year alone, The Biden-Harris administration signed the Broadband, Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program, which proposes $42.45 billion for high-speed internet access and the appropriate infrastructure to hold the bandwidth. Demanding internet for all, the latest BEAD funds have granted 2.4 million homes and small businesses with premium internet access. The Biden-Harris administration's policies include the Inflation Reduction Act which made insulin prices cap at $35 for more than 8 million Americans. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also emphasizes improvements in the areas of transportation, environmental, and broadband access. A proud Howard alumna, Harris also zeroed in on expanding the resources, opportunities, and services that HBCUs provide. As of October 9, The Harris-Biden Administration totaled their HBCU federal investments to $17 billion. The administration cited that, though HBCUs make up just 3% of all higher education institutions, HBCUs house 'twice as many Pell grantees from low- and middle-income families.' This rings true for Howard especially, as an estimated 41% of the student body receive federal Pell grants. Their Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, a student debt relief plan for nearly 5 million Americans was a direct attempt at eradicating America's racial wealth gap. According to the Education Data Initiative, forgiving student debt affects Black college graduates who owe nearly $25,000 more than white college graduates. Harris has also invited HBCU students to The White House. Last February, The Biden-Harris administration hosted their HBCU Celebration Day in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building to close out Black History Month. Student leaders and graduates gathered to discuss policy issues affecting HBCUs along with workforce advice for those graduating in Spring 2024. In 2023, 32 HBCU student journalists were invited to The White House in an intimate question-and-answer session that delved into the importance of their work from the experience of an HBCU education. Keisha Lance Bottoms, the former senior advisor to President Biden and alumna of Florida A&M University, facilitated the event. 'One of the blessings that I realized is [we] have a special responsibility, because you have had the good fortune and blessing of being in an academic environment that, in every way, from the walls that were constructed in your classmates and why they were built, you have the unique ability to know that we are counting on you and you represent the best of who we are,' Harris told the HBCU student journalists. 'We are requiring you to lead because we have learned in [HBCUs] that we stand on broad shoulders. They imagined we'd be having this conversation at the White House.' Harris' seven-stop HBCU Homecoming Tour was another intimate look for HBCU students and gave young Black voters an opportunity to understand her campaign up-close. Howard University 100th Homecoming anniversary celebration was slated for the opportunity, however, instead of an in-person appearance,
