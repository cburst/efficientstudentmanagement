such lengths to not appear out of step with Biden after his disastrous debate, she was starting from zero with just four months to go. One of the most pivotal, early decisions she made was to not emphasize the history-making elements of her identity as she sought to become the first female president of the United States - and also the first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent. The campaign believed she had to broaden her appeal, and that downplaying her identity would ensure voters who may not prioritize it were open to her candidacy. Janay Smith gives a long hug to her friend Tene Dolphin before Vice President Kamala Harris' concession event at Howard University in Washington, on Nov. 6, 2024. | Angelina Katsanis/POLITICO Her loss comes in one of the most tumultuous presidential races in U.S. history. Trump, the first president to become a convicted felon, will soon become only the second U.S. president, after Grover Cleveland, to regain the office after losing power. The final five months of the campaign included Trump's felony convictions on 34 charges related to hush money payments to a porn star and Trump being shot in the ear by a would-be assassin during a campaign rally, the first of two attempts on his life during the election cycle. In the final weekend before the election, Trump was still laboring under the controversy of his racist Madison Square Garden rally and adopting increasingly violent rhetoric - including saying he didn't 'mind' if someone had to 'shoot through' the media - while at times appearing to lose track of what state he was campaigning in. To many Democrats, it seemed the race was shifting. But Trump remained resilient. The outcome was in doubt from start to finish, with polls in all seven battleground states within the margin of error. And while she raised enormous sums of money - allowing her to outspend Trump on the air and on field work - Democrats at times expressed concerns about her campaign strategy. Just five years after she first ran for president, pitching herself as a progressive, Harris in her 2024 race aggressively courted moderates and disaffected Republicans. She leaned on former Trump officials and Republicans speaking out about the former president, and campaigned with members of the GOP like former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney. In the closing weeks of her campaign, the vice president homed in on an argument that a second Trump term posed a grave threat to democracy, returning to a message from the Biden era. The vice president delivered her closing argument from the Ellipse, the site of Trump's Jan. 6 rally - a venue her aides viewed as the perfect location for Harris to deliver a contrasting message about how she plans to govern. As some Democrats urged Harris to make democracy just one component of her closing argument, she delivered a forward-looking speech focused on her campaign's broader message: that Trump is focused on himself and his 'enemies list' while she will prioritize her 'to-do' list for Americans. And in her final speech of this campaign, Harris nodded to those same themes that animated the closing aspects of her campaign, with an implicit rebuke of the new president-elect.
