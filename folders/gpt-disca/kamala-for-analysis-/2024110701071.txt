Vice President Kamala Harris conceded her defeat in an address supporters Wednesday afternoon at Howard University, her alma mater in Washington, D.C. 'When we lose an election, we accept the results,' Harris told the crowd, drawing an implicit contrast to former President Donald Trump, who refused to commit to accepting the election's outcome. Harris called Trump earlier on Wednesday, conceding the historic election after a hard-fought race for the right to lead the nation. She discussed the importance of a peaceful transfer of power and being a president for all Americans with Trump, according to a senior Harris aide. Foes of Trump, meanwhile, promised to provide his administration no honeymoon. Hours after Trump's victory, advocacy groups were setting their sights on the president-elect, who will take office Jan. 20. The American Civil Liberties Union, which fought many controversial Trump policies during his first administration, said Wednesday that it already has a battle plan and would take action 'the minute he takes the oath of office.'

Kris Brown, president of the gun-safety group Brady, called Trump's election 'troubling' but pledged to continue the fight to prevent gun violence: 'Even though we won't have a friend in the White House, Brady isn't giving up an inch.' Sierra Club Executive Director Ben Jealous called Trump's first term a 'disaster for climate progress' and pledged to 'challenge Trump's dangerous proposals in court (and) keep the pressure on banks and big corporations to clean up their act.' Those advocacy groups will be facing a president whose party could emerge with majorities in the the House and Senate. GOP candidates picked up several pivotal Senate seats, including in West Virginia and Ohio, to seize control of the Senate. Results were still coming in for dozens of tightly contested House seats, but Speaker Mike Johnson issued a statement saying the 'latest data and trends indicate that when all the votes are tabulated, Republicans will have held our majority.'

President Joe Biden on Wednesday called President-elect Donald Trump to congratulate him on his election victory and invited him to a meeting at the White House during the presidential transition period - an invitation which Trump did not extend to him just four years ago. Biden's outreach to Trump isn't necessarily unusual - outgoing presidents traditionally meet with their successors before the formal inauguration. But it comes after Trump refused to extend a similar invitation to Biden during the 2020 presidential election. Trump also promoted fraudulent claims that the election was stolen and skipped Biden's inauguration. 'President Biden expressed his commitment to ensuring a smooth transition and emphasized the importance of working to bring the country together,' the White House said in a statement about the phone call. Trump Campaign Spokesperson Steven Cheung confirmed the call, saying in a statement that 'President Trump looks forward to the meeting, which will take place shortly, and very much appreciated the call.' The White House has yet to be set a date for Trump and Biden's encounter. Biden plans to address the country on Thursday to discuss the presidential transition efforts. - Karissa Waddick WASHINGTON Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday he spoke with President-elect Donald Trump and congratulated him on his decisive election win as the Ukrainian
