ticket tapped into the white identity voters' nationalism. She pitched herself to the white identitarian coalition that Trump has played like a fiddle. That is just more of the white identity politics on which American politics were built - and that the Black franchise should always be an indictment of. Obama's coalition feels like an aberration and it is time for us to accept that American politics is identity politics. It is a battle for the identities that will be named and shamed, while others are granted anonymity and power. Playing to the silent white identitarian does not guarantee victory if you aren't a white identity candidate. If we learn anything from Harris's loss, it should be that we must stop sacrificing the power of other identities - their values, their hopes, their security - for a chance that will not pan out. Black women have saved democracy enough times to deserve more than cosmetic diversity. We deserve more than hope and change. We deserve recognition and power. Above all, we deserve better than a post at the head of a sinking ship that reveres the iceberg. All this isn't to say the Harris campaign did not leave a mark. She proved the continuing importance of Black institutional life. The schools and churches and social groups that Black Americans cobbled together from the ashes of white violence and dispossession made her candidacy possible. Wealthy donors make you competitive. But a base makes you viable. Her competitiveness proved that Black culture can still make a powerful base. Kamala Harris would not be the first Black female vice president were it not for Howard University, a historically Black college, and her affiliation with Alpha Kappa Alpha, a Black Greek-letter sorority. Even her political base in California's Bay Area tapped into that area's racial history - the Black migration that built racial enclaves that became microsites of political power. Whether or not Harris's campaign alters the political imagination for Black female electoral power, the institutions she has brought along with her just might. But it won't be today, and it won't be this year. Tressie McMillan Cottom (@tressiemcphd) became a New York Times Opinion columnist in 2022.
