The remarks to the nation will be Biden's first appearance on camera in the aftermath of Donald Trump's decisive victory over Kamala Harris. Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr spoke about the election ahead of a game against the Boston Celtics. In August, he coached the U.S. Olympics men's team to a gold medal in Paris. 'Well, I believe in democracy, and I think the American people have spoken and voted for Trump, and I want him to do well the next four years. I want our country to do well.' 'It's a complex world. We've got a lot of interesting stuff between wars abroad, a global economy that has shifted everything in terms of what it means for our citizens and their day-to-day lives,' he said. 'I want what's best for us. I hope Trump can deliver.' Donald Trump ran a campaign centered on hypermasculinity, actively courting young men in particular with interviews on popular male-centric podcasts. In the closing weeks of the campaign, the former president and many of his surrogates leaned into sexist remarks and jokes about Vice President Kamala Harris. Some of his supporters, including former presidential rival Nikki Haley, warned that the former president risked exacerbating his persistent gender gap with Harris.

The decisive outcome spares the court from having to wade into election disputes. It also seems likely to change the tenor of cases that come before the justices, including on abortion and immigration. The two eldest justices - Clarence Thomas, 76, and Samuel Alito, 74 - could consider stepping down knowing that Trump, a Republican, would nominate replacements who might be three decades younger and ensure conservative domination of the court through the middle of the century, or beyond.

The Clintons had been some of the most outspoken Democratic critics of Trump. The former Democratic president stumped across the country for Harris and running mate Tim Walz, while the former secretary of state, Trump's opponent in 2016, had criticized her one-time rival throughout the entire election. The two commended Harris and Walz for running 'a positive, forward-looking campaign to be proud of.'
