Vice President Kamala Harris told supporters gathered at Howard University on Wednesday that she had lost the 2024 Election to Donald Trump, conceding to the Republican President-elect after a hard fought campaign. Here's what to know: Siga la cobertura de las elecciones de AP en espanol Watch live as Kamala Harris delivers her concession speech after Donald Trump was elected the 47th president of the United States. AP estimated late Wednesday evening that there are more than 200,000 ballots left to count in Nevada - including more than 130,000 in Clark County. Given the narrow margins in the races for president and U.S. Senate, both are too early to call. The AP will further review results released by Nevada election officials on Thursday. Officials in Arizona's Maricopa County said late Wednesday they've got more than 700,000 ballots left to count, which means races for president and U.S. Senate in the state will remain too early to call for another day. In all, AP estimates there are at least a million ballots to be added to the results in Arizona. County election officials are expected to firm up those numbers on Thursday. The FBI is warning of additional fabricated videos that misuse its name and insignia to undermine confidence in the electoral system. One of the videos falsely claims that the FBI was made aware that at least 301 electors reported attempted bribery and blackmail by a political party. Another video falsely claims that the FBI is investigating voter pressure at US military bases overseas, a third claims that a U.S. social media company has seen an increase in the number of separatist groups to include a total audience of more than 40 million people and the fourth falsely claims that the FBI has ordered media to restrict the spread of information about the bribery of electors. The FBI says each of the videos contains false information. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has congratulated Trump on his 'huge win' and discussed strengthening security and economic cooperation between the allies, according to a Seoul presidential official. Kim Tae-hyo, Yoon's deputy national security director, said Thursday that Yoon and Trump also discussed the growing threats posed by nuclear-armed North Korea, including its intercontinental ballistic missiles targeting the U.S. mainland, and its reported provision of troops to Russia in support of Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine. Kim said Trump called for expanding the countries' cooperation in the shipbuilding industries, highlighting South Korea's strengths in building warships and vessels, and called for more detailed discussions on improving U.S. competitiveness in ship exports as well as maintenance and repair. Kim said Yoon and Trump agreed to arrange an in-person meeting soon. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office said Trudeau congratulated Trump in a phone call. 'The two leaders discussed the enduring and successful partnership between Canada and the United States,' the statement said. The statement noted that they discussed trade, supply chains, global trading practices and North American security. CLAIM: President Joe Biden won approximately 20 million more votes in the 2020 election than Vice President Kamala Harris earned in the 2024 race, proving either that Trump has cheated his way to a second term or that there was widespread fraud four years ago. THE FACTS:
