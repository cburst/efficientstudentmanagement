different view or more detailed window into his plans on Ukraine simply doesn't know what he or she is talking about or doesn't understand that he makes his own calls on national-security issues, many times in the moment, particularly on an issue as central as this.' The president-elect spoke to the Ukrainian leader as late as Wednesday and has agreed to maintain close dialogue and cooperation. Pollster Frank Luntz explains to 'Fox News @ Night' how President-elect Trump exceeded polling projections and why Vice President Harris's actions were a direct impact on this election. 'She never actually told voters exactly what she would do in the first hour, in the first day, in the first week, in the first month, and voters have the right to know. She had the responsibility to tell them,' said Luntz. 'In the end, when she turned on him, Trump, started to call him all sorts of really horrific things. And, in the last week or 10 days, started calling him a fascist. Her negative started to go up, her popularity started to go down, and I think that that was a significant impact.' 'Don't forget, Republicans also gain seats in the Senate, and it looks like they're going to end up in control of the House,' said Luntz. 'This was not just a Donald Trump victory last night. This was a Republican victory up and down the ticket and there's going to be some reckoning in Washington in the next weeks and months.'

In a post on X on Wednesday afternoon, Melania said the Trump administration will protect freedom, which she described as 'the heart of our republic.' 'I anticipate the citizens of our nation rejoining in commitment to each other and rising above ideology for the sake of individual liberty, economic prosperity, and security,' she wrote in part. 'American energy, skill, and initiative will bring together our best minds to propel our nation forward forevermore.' Former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy took to X following his appearance on 'Hannity' tonight expressing his excitement at the election results and the promise of a more united front. 'We're more united than divided. Last night's results prove it. A new Republican Party is emerging, one that speaks to all Americans.' Ramaswamy's appearance shared an opinion that seems to be a common theme since the historic win for President-elect Donald Trump 'Sean, we get out of the echo chambers on the internet and just talk to people from Pennsylvania to Iowa to the West Coast of Nevada. We found that most Americans share the same common values. It was a beautiful thing to watch last night, and I think there was going to be a couple of good things to come out of it,' said Ramaswamy. 'Number one is, I think we're going to see a resurgence of national unity. Young people coming along in droves for Republicans. This is a new coalition. This is a new Republican party. This is a new country,' Ramaswamy said. 'The other positive thing. As a result of that, I think we're going to see, Sean, is a Democratic Party that at least finds its way back to sanity.' 'The Democratic Party is going to have to let go of the crazies on the progressive left and find its North Star again or else
