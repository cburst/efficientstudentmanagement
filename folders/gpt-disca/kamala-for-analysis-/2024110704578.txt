Democrat Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks won a U.S. Senate seat against former Republican Gov. Larry Hogan on Tuesday Alsobrooks became the first Black candidate to be elected senator in Maryland. 'It's remarkable to think that in two years, America will celebrate its 250th birthday.
