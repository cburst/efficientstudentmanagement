the Democratic Party is dead and either way that's a good win for the country,' he said. 'So we're still learning a lot from those election results, but the number one learning is there is a new coalition or united and there's unity to save this country and I'm excited that we're going to be a part of it.' Former presidential candidate, former Arkansas governor governor Mike Huckabee, believes President-elect Donald Trump's win was 'authentic on his part' and the work of 'a brilliant campaign.' On the 'The Evening Edit' Huckabee praised him saying he might as well be called 'President Lazarus.' 'Yeah, this wasn't a comeback. It was a resurrection, and it was a powerful one. He might be called President Lazarus after this, but I'll tell you what he said last night that was so very important for people to take in.this was not just an election about Donald Trump, this is a real movement, a genuine movement and a complete realignment of the political class' said Huckabee. Huckabee believes the American people have finally had their fill and Trump is their champion. 'We're just fed up with it and they're tired of Democrats and some of these Republicans who only care about their own globalist interests and they care about they're making money. And they didn't care that what they were doing and their policies were just strong jobs in this country,' said Huckabee. 'They were destroying their families and households and small communities and farms, and finally people had enough and Donald Trump was willing to carry the banner. He's done it brilliantly. He put together a coalition of people that most thought could never happen. He ran the tables. It's an overwhelming vote of support for a different kind of political. And I couldn't be happier,' he said. U.S. Senator Rick Scott took to X Wednesday evening reinforcing his commitment to support President-elect Donald Trump's agenda stating 'We have been given a mandate by the American people to support President Trump's agenda and Make Washington WORK again. I'm running to be the next Senate Majority leader to do just that. #LetsGetToWork.' Scott appeared on Kudlow and announced he will be running to be and will win the next Senate majority leader. 'I'm going to run. Larry, I'm going to win, and here's why,' said Scott. 'I've been talking to my Republican colleagues. Guess what they want? Change? They know that Trump has a mandate. They want to be part of that mandate. They don't want to be treated as equals. They want to be part of a team. They want to have a working relationship with the House. They know I've got a great working relationship with Trump, with Speaker Mike Johnson.' 'They know I'm a businessman. Businessmen get things done. We create a plan, we work our mission, we measure things, we create teams. That's exactly what we want in the Senate, and that's why I'll be the next majority leader, and we're going to get Trump's agenda accomplished.'
