Biden, she replied: 'Not a thing comes to mind.' Li told Fox News: 'That was the opener for her to show Americans that she's going to get tough on the border, that she's going to take drastic measures to bring down inflation. That was her chance.' Others also suggested Harris failed to distance herself enough from Biden and attempt to offer a change of direction for the country going forward. Biden was considered an unpopular president among voters who spent months seeking reelection despite concerns about the 81-year-old's ability to run for a second term in office. By the time Biden ended his 2024 bid and endorsed Harris, the vice president had around 100 days to convince voters to support her own campaign. 'We ran the best campaign we could, considering Joe Biden was president,' one unnamed Harris aide told Politico. 'Joe Biden is the singular reason Kamala Harris and Democrats lost.' Massachusetts Representative Seth Moulton, who was one of the first Democrats to urge Biden to end his reelection bid after the president's disastrous CNN debate performance, said it 'would have been better' if Harris had taken part and won the 2024 Democratic primary. '[I]t was necessary for the Democratic nominee to separate him or herself from an unpopular incumbent, as much as we love Joe Biden,' Moulton told Politico. 'None of those things happened.' Jamal Simmons, the vice president's former communications director, said Harris fully breaking from Biden for her campaign would have been a 'trap' and seized upon as another Republican attack line. 'You can't really run away from the president who chooses you,' Simmons told the BBC. MSNBC's Joy Reid defended Harris, suggesting the vice president had a 'historic flawlessly run' campaign which included the endorsement of several high-profile celebrities such as Taylor Swift and Beyonce. 'You could not have run a better campaign in that short period of time,' Reid said. Harris formally conceded the election to Trump during a speech at Howard University in Washington, D.C, on Wednesday, urging her supporters 'do not despair' at the results. 'This is not a time to throw up our hands. This is a time to roll up our sleeves,' Harris said. 'This is a time to organize, to mobilize and to stay engaged for the sake of freedom and justice and the future that we all know we can build together.'
