Letter to My Daughter: A Vote for Your Future A man with an electric guitar, speaker, and backing vocals sang soul ballads. A dude on a bicycle - wearing a Harris/Walz T-shirt and a full-face monkey mask, for some reason - raced back and forth, weaving in and out of the lines. There was a bootleg Elmo, scooting around on an electric unicycle. Lots of Harris/Walz camouflage baseball caps. I'd been shuffling in my line for about an hour when some quick mental calculations led me to conclude I probably wasn't going to get into the main venue. By then, the overflow section stretched a good 100 yards from the entrance across the street to the base of the Washington Monument. Word went around that there were 75,000 people in the crowd. It felt like twice that. After wedging my way through the thick crowd and interviewing about a half-dozen people - including Black women, who among the most skeptical that Americans would vote for someone who looked like them - I realized the good vibes were legit. They truly believed in Harris. That's when I began to believe that joy could triumph over fear; that positivity might actually overcome pessimism and doubt. Black women, I thought, can and should be seen. And whenever democracy needs rescuing, we instinctively look to them for the job. The polls close in mere hours, and we might not know the results of the election tonight. But what I saw at that rally will forever remind me of comedian Trevor Noah's shout-out to his mother and grandmother on his final broadcast of 'The Daily Show': 'Unlike everybody else, Black women can't afford to f- around and find out.'
