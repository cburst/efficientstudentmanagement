about the future of 'democracy'; they warned about disrupting free trade. Harris's slogan of 'we're not going back' said it all: a campaign defined by being anti-Trump rather than for anything. A strategy intended to woo 'moderates' left nearly everyone cold. Harris started her campaign differently, by promising to hunt down price-gouging corporates. That policy was popular, but there was little else. She went policy-lite, so as to present Trump with less of a target. Among the supporters she wheeled out this autumn was the billionaire Mark Cuban. In a country where the richest 0.1% own nearly 20% of all wealth - almost as much as 90% of Americans put together - this is almost the definition of anti-populist politics. We probably won't hear much about billionaires over the next few days. If the commentariat's form from 2016 is anything to go by, the sketch will be of angry left-behinds and rednecks rallying to a strongman. Never mind that last night's exit polls showed Trump as personally less popular than Harris, or that more than half of voters judge his views to be 'too extreme'. Not to mention that Trump is easily the richest man ever to serve in the White House, with a personal net worth of about $5.5bn (4.3bn). A marketing man, skilled at targeting discontent, Trump does not follow his crowds. Rather, he is led by the money men around him: the fossil fuel executives, the shadow bankers, the crypto bros and the world's richest man, Elon Musk. Mitt Romney and George W Bush could always rely on some stuffed shirts from the Fortune 500 to hand over a few tens of thousands. But Trump's donor class is very different. They include men like Stephen Schwarzman, head of the world's largest private equity firm, Blackstone, billionaire investor Nelson Peltz and Silicon Valley's David Sacks. They're not company men building relationships but, as Trump styles himself, dealmakers. This lot have shelled out a lot more to get in Trump (Musk alone has spent an estimated $100m), and expect their money's worth. 'They're less concerned about the photo op and a visit to the White House,' as one former bagman for Trump told the New Yorker. 'They want to essentially get their issues in the White House.' Trump has reportedly lined up Musk to become his 'secretary of cost cutting', while in April, the US's next president demanded oil executives give him $1bn to beat the Democrats. In return, he said, he'd let them do a lot more drilling. Slashed regulations and lower taxes are Trump's way of keeping donors on side. Last time he was in the White House, he brought in $1.5tn of tax cuts that meant the richest 400 families in the US paid a lower tax rate than their secretaries, nannies, cleaners and anyone else in the working class. You can expect a lot more like it over the next four years. Trump will almost certainly plunder from the budgets for social security and Medicaid. The tech bros will suckle on government subsidies, while the suits from private equity get to set government policy. However this politics dresses itself, it's not populism. Try: theft - taking from the poor to give to the rich. Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
