And to the American people, for their trust. I will never stop fighting for ALL of you.' The Ohio senator is expected to move into the vice president's residence in Northwest D.C., on the grounds of the United States Naval Observatory - Vice President Kamala Harris' current home. Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley celebrated Trump's White House return and said his side of the aisle 'is Donald Trump's party.' Whatley called Tuesday night's victory a 'fundamental realignment of American politics' with 'a historic shift with Black voters, with Asian voters, with Hispanic voters.' 'We are very happy that there is going to be a focus on America and there's going to be a focus on American families,' Whatley told Fox News. Exit polls showed Trump made big strides with Latino voters, who went 53% to 45% to Harris after going 66-32 for Biden four years ago. Black voters remained generally loyal to the Democratic ticket (86-12 for Harris, 87-12 for Biden) but was a smaller share of the total vote in 2024 versus 2020, down to 11% from 13%. A Michigan man who showed up to the visitors' center of the U.S. Capitol on Election Day smelling like fuel and carrying a torch and a flare gun also brought an apparent manifesto about war in the Middle East, police say. Austin M. Olson, 28, of Westland, Michigan, is charged with possession of a prohibited weapon, unlawful activities and disorderly conduct, U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) said Wednesday morning. USCP said Olson was in the process of going through security at the Capitol Visitor Center about 12:30 p.m. when officers discovered the torch and flare gun in his jacket. Police also found 'what appears to be a manifesto' and a letter to Congress about the suspect's opinions on war in the Middle East, USCP said. Police did not elaborate on what the letter said, and the agency is still trying to figure out why Olson showed up at the Capitol with those items, USCP said. Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said that as of Wednesday morning, the president-elect has not received any kind of call from Harris or Biden. Here's how cities, counties and congressional districts in the DMV voted. Choose which race you're interested in at the top, then click a district to zoom in. Republican Derrick Anderson said that there are 'thousands of outstanding ballots to count' in Virginia's 7th Congressional District in a statement on X. 'Simply put, like so many other races across the country, this race remains too close to call,' Anderson said on X. 'And like many other races across the country, it has not been called by any major media outlet.' His opponent Democrat Eugene Vindman declared victory in the critical 7th Congressional District. According to Anderson's statement, a local media outlet misreported a false race call Tuesday night, 'causing a considerable amount of confusion and misreporting.' NBC News has not declared a winner in the race, and Republican Derrick Anderson has not conceded. Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to deliver a speech to the country and her supporters at her alma mater Howard University, a campaign co-chair confirmed to NBC News. Her election night watch party was held at Howard Tuesday night. The campus served as a headquarters, and Harris had hoped to make a victory speech there. Although she did not speak to her supporters on election night, her campaign co-chair promised she
