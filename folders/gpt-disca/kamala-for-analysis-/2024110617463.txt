powerful essay on why her student loan debt made her a better leader, as opposed to a fiscally irresponsible one. She embodied the racial wealth gap that condemns Black Americans to what the sociologist Louise Seamster has called 'bad debt' - the debt we take on to earn our way out of poor economic opportunities. That looks like bad mortgages and upside-down car loans and, yes, student loans for the education we have to have to get our foot in the door. Admittedly, Abrams had to own this part of her political biography. She spent most of her childhood in the South. But if this country were to put a Southern Black woman with the shared experience of millions of working-class and aspirational Black Americans in the White House, her ascendancy would be a statement on this country's original sin. The sin that still animates housing segregation, school inequality, wage inequality and environmental racism. The idea of Abrams as president is merely an example of a different kind of campaign, on an alternate timeline, where being first could have given us a first worth voting for. Will more Black women run because of Kamala Harris? Almost definitely. Will more Black women win using Kamala Harris's playbook? I hope not. Black feminism - and especially the idea of intersectionality - became a pop culture cliche in the 2020s. But Harris took a more traditional second-wave feminist approach to her performance of womanhood. Her campaign did not challenge gender conventions so much as it selectively subverted some gender expectations (and left others intact) for her political benefit. She has this in common with Sarah Palin, another first who almost went the distance. I always believed that a conservative woman would be the first female president because of what social science says about gender and leadership. American voters demand compensating qualities - gun-toting, conventional attractiveness, religiosity - to accept a female president. Harris played that game, finessing that hybrid centrist conservative in a progressive package. That feels like a game plan for the many female candidates who will follow in her footsteps. It is less clear to me that Harris's game plan can ever actually work for a Black female candidate. For one thing, Black women cannot usurp Palin's gun-toting, America-first political shtick. Harris came close. On the trail, Harris (and Walz) talked about packing a gun the way women in politics were once expected to talk about packing their kids' school lunches. She also delighted in being tough on crime. By pivoting to the right, Harris bet that American voters trust female politicians who present as culturally conservative, like Palin. Harris just did it from the Democratic ticket. That choice is part of her legacy. What isn't part of her legacy is the end of identity politics. Try as some might to bury the salience of race, class and gender to political life, identity still matters. And it mattered to Harris's campaign. The devil is in how people misunderstand what identity politics is. The common-sense understanding of identity politics is that it is rooted in the shared group identity based on linked oppressions. That link to oppression is key. It is why only minorities are thought to have an 'identity' in identity politics. By that definition, Kamala Harris would have to bleat her horn about breaking glass ceilings. That is what Hillary Clinton infamously did in her nomination acceptance speech in 2016. She also would have gone Jesse Jackson with a rhyme about hope and dope and a rope that overtly draws on the Black
