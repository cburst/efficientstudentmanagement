even Harris' campaign - seemed either unwilling or unable to really address these structural divisions, economic inequality and their own role in the greatly changed economy in the US, dating back to the decisions of the Clinton administration in the 1990s. Harris also had to walk this impossible line in attempting to be the 'change candidate' while not disavowing the Biden administration. There's been a lot of attention in the US media today about a moment in early October on The View, a popular talk show, in which Harris was asked what she would have done differently than Biden over the last four years, if given the chance. And she said nothing came to mind. It's entirely possible the Democrats will take the wrong lesson out of this campaign. There are recriminations already coming from the right of the party that Harris had moved too far to the left and should have spent more time trying to appeal to Republican voters in states like Pennsylvania. But I think you could make the opposite argument - that the Democrats failed to listen to their base in places like Michigan, where there was so much anger for the Biden administration's support for Israel in its war on Gaza. In the Democratic primaries earlier this year, for instance, some 100,000 people in Michigan voted 'uncommitted' instead of for Biden. And when you consider the fact that Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian representative in Congress, was re-elected with a huge majority in Michigan, as was Representative Ilhan Omar in Minnesota, this suggests Harris' campaign did not mobilise the base in the way that it needed to. They didn't listen to what the base was telling them. The Democrats need to look now at offering real structural economic change that addresses inequality and a reassessment of the US role in the world. They can't underestimate the appeal of Trump's line about Russia's invasion of Ukraine, for instance - that this wouldn't have happened under a Trump presidency. Many Americans are exhausted with American-led wars or American involvement in wars overseas - and I think that's another thing the Harris campaign and Biden administration were either unable or unwilling to hear that.
