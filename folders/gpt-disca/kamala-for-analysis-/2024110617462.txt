a better story about the fundamentals without promising anything to fix those fundamentals. That is the sweet spot for an opportunist like Trump and his party. Sell everything, promise nothing. Keep them coming back for more. The Harris campaign countered with a relatively hopeful message about the future. But the candidate ultimately ran on a platform of stasis. Her promise was that nothing much would change about the country but the race and gender of the one in charge - and she didn't even lean into a history-making narrative about her race and gender because it felt like a promise she could not keep. A promise of a more audacious America. Maybe how she almost won is the reason she could not win. I was never going to be a big fan of some of Harris's politics. I do not believe in police reform and she is a 'law and order' Democrat, for one example. But I am a pragmatic voter. I know that most Americans are center-right and that the left has not yet built the power base necessary to make most Americans center-left. She was always going to be the only legitimate candidate in a race against Donald Trump, a felon and self-aggrandizing political troll. Perhaps more important, when she became the Democratic nominee, it did not feel like a conquest. It felt like a Hail Mary. The stink of our national desperation has haunted me since Harris accepted the nomination. It called to mind how Black women become firsts in other arenas. Research shows that women often inherit leadership roles when organizations are in crisis. That kind of risk exposure is especially acute for women of color. Desperate companies and nonprofits blow through their wunderkind leaders and turn to women, who often have fewer organizations competing for their talents. They can get them at a good deal - female C.E.O.s often make less than male C.E.O.s. And when the organizational fractures are too deep to be fixed or the female leaders are given too little authority or resources to fix them, they are blamed for the failures they inherited. It was a short election cycle. Harris didn't have a victory lap after early primaries or on Super Tuesday. We did not get a chance to invest in Harris's capabilities, only her willingness to inherit our broken mess. And the early forensics of her campaign read like a funeral program instead of a celebration of life. Notably, there are numerous obituaries for 'identity politics' that argue that Harris's decision to de-emphasize her race and gender in her campaign means that diversity is dead as an overt political strategy. But what if she should have leaned into identity more, risking the white identity voter but telling us a clear story about why electing her would speak about our audacious potential? We cannot know for sure. We do know that she declined to write the narrative of her historic firsts throughout her campaign, while Trump wrote the second volume of his story of which identities should matter most. Harris's campaign positioned race and gender not as strengths to be reclaimed but flaws to be subsumed. If you have to hide the light of your race and gender behind the metaphorical bushes to come vaguely close to being the first Black female president, then identity still matters very much indeed. Imagine someone like Southern-bred Stacey Abrams being the first Black female president. Put aside whether Abrams's politics are better or worse - that is not necessary for this exercise. What matters is that when she ran for governor of Georgia, she leaned into how much race and gender shaped her Americanness. I will never forget her
