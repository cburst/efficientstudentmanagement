(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) Democrats spent billions of dollars warning American voters that Donald Trump posed an imminent threat to democracy, that his economic policies would benefit only his wealthy friends, that he was literally a fascist. In the end, voters didn't care - or if they did, it didn't matter. And now, after Kamala Harris' decisive loss, Democrats enter a second Trump presidency with no clear leader, no clear plan and no agreement on what caused them to be so wrong about the 2024 election. 'I think there needs to be a cleaning of the house, there needs to be a new generation of leaders that emerge,' said Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., among the few Democrats with presidential ambitions to address the party's future on Wednesday. 'There needs to be new thinking, new ideas and a new direction. And, you know, the establishment produced a disaster.' Read more about the Democrats' future Former President Donald Trump won Alaska and its three electoral votes on Wednesday, adding to his lead in the Electoral College. Trump continues a decadeslong trend of Republicans carrying the state in the presidential race. When discussing Alaska, he has often cited his role while president in the passage of a 2017 tax law that called for oil and gas leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Trump endorsed in Alaska's other high-profile race this election cycle, backing Republican Nick Begich for U.S. House. The Associated Press declared Trump the winner at 4:59 p.m. EST. More than 70 national, state and local LGBTQ+ rights and advocacy organizations released a 'solidarity statement' Wednesday reacting to the results of this week's elections. 'Election outcomes at national, state, and local levels will impact our health, our safety, and our rights as LGBTQIA2S+ people and families,' the statement read. 'Despite anti-LGBTQIA2S+ efforts to divide our communities, and particularly severe attacks against transgender people and LGBTQIA2S+ youth, we have succeeded in moving a few steps closer toward equity and justice for our community.' The letter highlighted the reelection of lesbian U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and the election of the first transgender member of Congress, Rep.-elect Sarah McBride, of Delaware. The statement did not mention Trump by name. But he and other Republican candidates frequently employed anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric in campaign ads, remarks and platforms, particularly against transgender and nonbinary people. The statement was signed by groups including the National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, GLAAD, many PFLAG and Equality chapters, the Transgender Law Center, Advocates for Trans Equality, and the Trevor Project, a youth suicide prevention organization.
