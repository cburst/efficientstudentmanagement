'The American people have spoken and Karen and I send our sincere congratulations to President-Elect Donald Trump and his family on his election as 47th President of the United States,' Pence wrote on X, while also congratulating Trump's running mate, JD Vance. 'We extend our congratulations as well to the newly elected members of the Republican majorities in the United States Senate and the House of Representatives and look forward to their efforts to renew American security, prosperity and a respect for life,' he added. 'We will continue to pray for all those in authority and urge every American to join us in praying for our incoming President, Vice President and elected officials at every level. God Bless America.' Pence served as Trump's vice president during his first term. The pair had a falling out after Pence rebuffed Trump's attempts to have him overturn President Biden's 2020 president election.

'The Democratic Party proved itself to be fundamentally undemocratic. It needs a complete reboot,' wrote Ackman. 'The leadership should be thrown out and those responsible should apologize to the American people.' In the same post, Ackman praised how social media site X, bolstered by Elon Musk's drive for free speech on the platform, brought President-elect Trump to victory. 'Half the country has believed that @X is filled with mis- and disinformation, and that they could only therefore rely on The NY Times, MSNBC, CNN and other mainstream media for their news. And they did,' wrote Ackman. 'If, however, you have been active on @X for the last year, you have known the truth days, weeks and often months before the facts appear in the MSM.' According to Ackman, the mainstream media sought to portray President Biden to be 'fit as a fiddle' while simultaneously defaming President-elect Trump. He credits new media like podcasts for offering a different picture of Donald Trump to the American people. Ackman has 1.5 million followers on X. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appeared somber and teary-eyed while waiting to see defeated candidate Vice President Harris make a concession speech on Wednesday. Arriving at Howard University on Wednesday afternoon, Pelosi was photographed greeting Harris supporters while appearing tearful. In a particularly emotional picture, Pelosi pouted as if just about to weep, and had watery eyes. Other pictures showed Pelosi smiling at the event and mingling with attendees. Harris' concession speech comes after a historic neck-and-neck presidential race ended with a Trump victory early Wednesday morning. While the election was expected to be a toss-up, the scope of Trump's victory shocked both sides of the
