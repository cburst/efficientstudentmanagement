elegiac tradition. That is what then-candidate Barack Obama did in 2008. Given that her Indian American heritage does not have the same kind of resonant political story as women's and Black Americans', if she had leaned into that identity as a key part of her campaign strategy, she would have had to invent one. If you think identity politics means 'performing an identity,' then Harris bucked the progressive habit of leveraging identity politics. Someone looking to build on her campaign's progress might think that Harris lost because she didn't ham up the guns and nationalism enough and bury her identity even deeper. That is wrong and it is racist. And it is also wrong because it is racist. It is racist to believe that racial identity is an affliction that only weak-willed or weak-minded minorities suffer. When we limit identity politics to minorities, we insist that in politics only nonwhite people have racial identities (and to a lesser extent, that only women have gendered identities). If you accept that everyone has a racial identity - which is very hard to refute - then every political individual engages in identity politics. White voters are also identity voters. In fact, they are the most important of all identity-driven voters. It was their votes that Harris had to court. I thought a lot this election season about a book by the political scientist Ashley Jardina, 'White Identity Politics,' published in 2019, that examines how much white racial attitudes are rooted in their white identity politics. Jardina's data supports the theory that white voters feel, and therefore act, in ways that support their view of themselves as white. They are not necessarily prejudiced against minorities. In fact, Jardina argues that the empirical connection between prejudiced views and white identitarianism is pretty weak. A lot of white people don't feel white and yet vote and act in racially prejudiced ways. And some white people feel white, vote from a white identity and do not particularly act in racially prejudiced ways. White identity voters are not located just in conservative areas, like the South. They aren't all Republicans or conservative voters or poor or working class. Jardina is clear that white identity politics has increased across the income, ideological and geographical spectra. Trump's final electoral map picked up new voters, kept his core voters and found new identity voters - Latinos, Black men and immigrants. Harris may not have emphasized her own identity in her campaign but her campaign absolutely emphasized the interests of those white identity voters who may have leaned toward Trump in 2016. Those voters tend to be threatened by, and therefore obsessed with, immigration. This was the source of candidate Harris's hard center-right turn. Time and time again, she put her experience as a prosecutor and an attorney general forward when she talked about securing the border. She embraced American exceptionalism abroad and policing at home. She did not appear to kowtow to the Democratic Party's left wing. Palestinian supporters did not succeed in getting a Palestinian speaker onstage at the Democratic National Convention. She did not utter now-toxic slogans like 'abolish the police.' And she pushed back on those who tried to position her as a 'D.E.I.' candidate. Neoconservatives like Dick Cheney endorsed Harris not only because Trump is so dangerous; on issues like national and domestic security, it's hard to pass a light between her positions and those of a typical conservative. The nation's first Black woman on a national
