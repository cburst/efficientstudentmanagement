God. My allegiance to all three is why I am here to say while I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign, the fight, the fight for freedom, for opportunity, for fairness and the dignity of all people. A fight for the ideals at the heart of our nation, the ideals that reflect America at our best. That is a fight. I will never give up. I will never give up the fight for a future where Americans can pursue their dreams, ambitions and aspirations. Where the women of America have the freedom to make decisions about their own bodies and not have their government telling them what to do. We will never give up the fight to protect our schools and our streets from gun violence and America. We will never give up the fight for our democracy, for the rule of law, for equal justice and for the sacred idea that every one of us no matter who we are or where we start out has certain fundamental rights and freedoms that must be respected and upheld. And we will continue to wage this fight in the voting booth in the courts and in the public square. And we will also wage it in quieter ways in how we live our lives, by treating one another with kindness and respect by looking in the face of a stranger and seeing a neighbor by always using our strength to lift people up to fight for the dignity that all people deserve. The fight for our freedom will take hard work. But like I always say, we like hard work, hard work is good work, hard work can be joyful work and the fight for our country is always worth it. It is always worth it. To the young people who are watching it is to the young people who are watching it is ok to feel sad and disappointed. But please know it's going to be ok on the campaign. I would often say when we fight, we win. But here's the thing, here's the thing. Sometimes the fight takes a while. That doesn't mean we won't win. That doesn't mean we won't win. The important thing is, don't ever give up, don't ever give up. Don't ever stop trying to make the world a better place. You have power, you have power. And don't you ever listen, when anyone tells you something is impossible because it has never been done before. You have the capacity to do extraordinary good in the world. And so to everyone who is watching, do not despair. This is not a time to throw up our hands. This is a time to roll up our sleeves. This is a time to organize, to mobilize and to stay engaged for the sake of freedom and justice and the future that we all know we can build together. Look many of, you know, I started out as a prosecutor and throughout my career, I saw people at some of the worst times in their lives. People who had suffered great harm and great pain and yet found within themselves, the strength and the courage and the resolve to take the stand to take a stand to fight for justice to fight for themselves, to fight for others. So let their courage be our inspiration, let their determination be our charge. And I'll close with this. There's an adage, an historian once called a Law of History. True of every society across the ages. The adage is only when it is dark enough. Can you see the stars? I know many people feel like we are entering a dark time, but for the benefit of us all, I hope that is not the case. But here's the thing America. If it is, let us fill the sky with the light of a brilliant, brilliant billion of stars, the light, the light of optimism, of faith, of truth and service... hu and may that work guide us even in the face of setbacks toward the extraordinary promise of the United States of America.
