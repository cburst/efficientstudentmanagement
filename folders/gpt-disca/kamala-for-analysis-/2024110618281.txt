His resounding victory will be blamed on 'populism', but that's lazy thinking. He addressed the key concerns far better than the Democrats did Since we'll hear a lot, again, about 'populism', let's remember, again, that 19th-century US populism had a healthy strain of leftwing politics. Defending workers, riling up bankers, decrying the 'cross of gold' and economic conservatism: look past his Bible-bashing, and William Jennings Bryan was a precursor to Franklin Roosevelt. Yet for much of this election year, the populists' modern-day successors in the Democrats have served up an anti-populism: telling voters they were wrong. Americans were told they were wrong to see the corrosion of Joe Biden's abilities, and wrong to think that his replacement should not be decided in a giant backroom stitch-up. They were wrong not to enjoy the US economic miracle, and wrong not to worry about the future of democracy. Black and brown people and students were wrong to expect the party to oppose the bloodbath in Gaza. Latinos were ungrateful to desert the party of racial equality, while Black men were boneheaded not to back a Black woman. Everyone was wrong not to lap up the rallies opened by Beyonce and Usher, the skits on Saturday Night Live and that clip of Barack Obama rapping. Why couldn't they just feel the joy? For reasons I'll explain in a moment, I'm no fan of explanations that begin and end with the bogeyman of 'populism'. They almost always wind up with well-lunched commentators ventriloquising the opinions of people they've never talked to and in whose worlds they've never set foot. Look at the exit polls and you see a materialist explanation for what's just happened: two out of three US voters report their economy is bad. And they have an excellent point. As I wrote last month, look at the data over the long run and two big trends stand out. First, for the vast majority of US employees - whether middle class or working class, teacher or shop assistant - wages have flatlined. Not for four or even 20 years - but for most of the past half century. Strip out inflation, and average hourly earnings for seven out of 10 employees have barely risen since Richard Nixon was in the White House. I can't think of a more flammable political economy than a country with a few very rich people where most workers only get by because of low gas and food prices. Then what happens? A second blow. Covid peters out, the world comes out of lockdown and low-wage America is doused in that most combustible of economic substances: inflation. The entire system goes up - and Donald Trump spots his chance. Faced with the flames, what would be a left-populist response? It wouldn't be to resort to pedantry, to correct angry voters by showing them the aggregate figures - but that's what many Democrat supporters did. Nor would it be to roll back all the benefits extended over the pandemic: the improved child tax credit, Medicaid and unemployment insurance. But that's what Joe Biden did, even as he shovelled billions into infrastructure. The electoral result was that working- and middle-class voters peeled away from the Democrats. Kamala Harris won the most affluent voters, while Trump took those earning between $50,000 (39,000) and $100,000 (77,000). The two tied for those on $50,000 and below. So much for Harris being part of the most pro-worker government since the 1960s. Just as the electorate professed fury with the entire political and economic system, she and the Democrats made themselves the system's defenders. They weren't change but more of the same. They worried
