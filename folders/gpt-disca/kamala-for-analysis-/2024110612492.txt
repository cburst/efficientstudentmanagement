heard our daughter's anti-Trump rant earlier in the year, around the time VP Harris became the presumptive nominee, we laughed, not knowing where it came from. Maybe her feisty grandmas on both sides, who were also anticipating this day, taught her that. As November 5 approached, Cross' convictions grew stronger. 'Donald Trumpet is a nasty man, he's trashy,' Cross screamed in her sweet little voice. 'Comma-la will win!' And now we have to sit her down and tell her that America chose a person who is anti-woman. What hurts more is that I hear men - so-called progressives - champion women every day while doing nothing meaningful to help propel them through sexist spaces. Male leaders from every demographic talk about the power of women, but do they hold space for them? They champion women in leadership as an idea, but what do they do to make it a reality? I saw Black and Brown men, from my own community, who were raised by their single mothers and single grandmas, scream for ' Trump!' I don't get it. Are they delusional, or do they hate women, or both? This loss is even more personal for me, considering the battles I watched many women in my life take on. As a teenager, I watched my mother, a talented phlebotomist, be robbed of promotions at Johns Hopkins Hospital where she worked for 20 years. She was often responsible for training the person who would be supervising her. I watched my grandma run our family full of dysfunctional men who were completely lost after she died. While alive, she was never acknowledged for her leadership. They both had to find a way to survive in Trump's America. Sadly, we are still there. What's even more sad is that I was not surprised. What hurts more is that I hear men - so-called progressives - champion women every day while doing nothing meaningful to help propel them through sexist spaces. Throughout this entire campaign, Caron and Cross remained beyond confident. The two were delicate like bombs whenever they witnessed anyone displaying the slightest bit of uncertainty. I couldn't help being skeptical, though, because I remember in 2016, thinking Hillary Clinton was going to have this moment. Her skill set says she should have won, but America has a history of getting it wrong. In 2016, we got it very wrong. So yes, I was terrified. I was terrified because America has a way of ignoring blatant racism. As if Trump never took out that ad advocating for the Central Park 5 to be executed; as if he hasn't flirted with Nazi-style imagery and references; as if he never said there were good people on both sides in Charlottesville even though one side united to celebrate and praise hate; as if he never called countries that were full of proud people of color sh**holes. I was terrified. The low morale of Democrats while Biden ran for reelection was haunting. There was no energy, little celebrity movement, few campaign signs and cheeky bumper stickers. It felt like we weren't in election season and that was terrifying. Political conversations in my friend groups, which are filled with hard-working people who care about the progress of this country, ended with nothing more than shrugs about voting for Biden again. No one was offering to host a campaign dinner, no one was rocking a Biden hoodie, and definitely no one was sending out emails or knocking on any doors. But smart people know excitement wins elections. And Trump had all of the excitement until the Kamala effect. It was telling when Harris announced her candidacy and a collection of blue and white campaign signs flooded every liberal district, seemingly
