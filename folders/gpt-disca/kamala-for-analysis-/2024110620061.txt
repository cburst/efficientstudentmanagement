Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a speech Wednesday afternoon a few hours after officially conceding in a phone call to President-elect Donald Trump. Harris, who became the Democratic presidential nominee after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July, delivered the speech at 4 p.m. ET from Howard University in Washington, D.C., the White House confirmed. Trump came out ahead of Harris in a hard-fought campaign that ended with Trump's decisive victory in which he captured several battleground states including North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Harris did not make a speech during her election night party Tuesday night at Howard University, a historically Black college where she was an undergraduate. As voting returns came in, it became clear early Wednesday morning Trump would ultimately win a second term in the White House. Sign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.
