political constituency in America. The second assumption is that Harris could not afford to break decisively with President Biden on anything of substance. Rather than making a meaningful pivot on Israel and Palestine, Harris inexplicably dispatched Rep. Ritchie Torres and former President Bill Clinton to Michigan to appeal to Arabs and Muslims who, unsurprisingly, ended up rejecting her anyway. And instead of acknowledging that the Biden-Harris campaign may have erred in some early administration immigration decisions, she went on The View and said that she couldn't think of anything that she would have done differently. This worked out about as well for her as refusing to disavow George W. Bush's Iraq War did for Republican nominee John McCain in 2008. I will never understand why the campaign calculated that it couldn't do this. Who were they afraid of? Joe Biden? What was he going to do, call her into the Oval Office and slur his way through some sort of admonishment? And if she wasn't going to break with Biden, the least she could have done was try to convince people that the economy is actually good. I know voters tuning in at the last minute aren't known for their understanding of nuance, but if the story is that the administration believes real wages outpaced inflation, and that the U.S. recovery from the pandemic is the best in the world, why not say that over and over? Why not brag about the stock market? Why not open every rally by asking people to take out their phones and load their 401k charts? It certainly worked for Trump. Pinning this entirely on Harris, however, is a mistake. Voters seemed tired of being governed by Democrats and, fairly or unfairly, blamed the party for their sense that the country is on the wrong track. It is not clear to me that any candidate could have successfully navigated through those headwinds, even with a perfect campaign. Democrats will certainly have plenty of time in the wilderness over the next two years to think about how to avoid putting themselves in this position again.
