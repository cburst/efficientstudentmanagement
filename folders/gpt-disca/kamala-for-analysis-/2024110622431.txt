2024 Elections In her concession speech, she included an implicit rebuke of the president-elect. Vice President Kamala Harris waves to the crowd following her concession speech at Howard University in Washington, on Nov. 6, 2024, after losing the presidential election to Donald Trump. | Angelina Katsanis/POLITICO By Eugene Daniels and Myah Ward 11/06/2024 05:43 PM EST Link Copied It was decades ago when Kamala Harris forged her political identity on the grounds of Howard University. And on Wednesday, she returned to the campus to mark the end of her short, historic run for the White House. Less than 24 hours from when she was expected to address a waiting jubilant crowd, Harris stood in front of the Frederick Douglass Memorial Hall at her alma mater. Gone were the throngs of Howard students hoping to see one of their own lead the country. Instead, forlorn and crying staffers were front and center, hoping to hear their boss help them process the loss. 'While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign. The fight for freedom, for opportunity, for fairness and for the dignity of all people. A fight for the ideals at the heart of our nation. The ideals that reflect an America at our best. That is a fight I will never give up,' the vice president said. While not the speech of the next president of the United States, it was clearly a speech she and her team hope will set her up to be the leader of whatever resistance the party is able to muster up in a Trump presidency. 'Do not despair. This is not a time to throw up our hands, this is a time to roll up our sleeves,' Harris told the crowd. 'The fight for our freedom will take hard work. But like I say, hard work is good work, hard work can be joyful work, and the fight for our country is always worth it.' This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Senior Harris aides are still torn on what happened and know the recriminations have already started: Biden should have never run for reelection. The racism and sexism in the country was too much to overcome. She should have distanced herself from the administration's Middle East policy. It really was just the economy, stupid. According to multiple Harris aides and allies granted anonymity this result is, in ways, easier to swallow. Had it been the razor-thin margins they anticipated, they say, she and them would spend the next few weeks thinking through every interview (or lack thereof) to catch the wrong phrase, or which battleground she should have visited more. Instead, many feel there was something deeper in the electorate that they could not easily overcome. After Biden's disastrous debate in June and his withdrawal from the race after several weeks of heavy pressure from Democrats, Harris quickly became the party's consensus choice in a history-making bid. At 60, she is some two decades younger than Biden, 81, and Trump, who is 78. The vice president moved to call Democratic leaders to shore up her support and benefited from an early surge in momentum, energizing voters apathetic about another Biden-Trump rematch. Yet while Democrats basked in the excitement surrounding her candidacy, Harris and her team were under an exceedingly compressed timeline. She had to take over a bloated campaign organization and attempt to add some of her new staff all while selecting a running mate; prepare for the debate with Trump; and deliver an acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention. And since Harris and her advisers had gone through
