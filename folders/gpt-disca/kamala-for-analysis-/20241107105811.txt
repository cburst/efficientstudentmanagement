Kamala Harris' 'devastating loss.' 'It was a privilege to spend the last 100 days with @KamalaHarris and the amazing staff led by @jomalleydillon who left it all on the field for their country,' Plouffe wrote on X. 'We dug out of a deep hole but not enough. A devastating loss. Thanks for being in the arena, all of you.' In the wake of former President Donald Trump's historic win projected by the Fox News Decision Desk, several winners and losers of the 2024 election have become clear. Here are those who came out on top on Election Day and those who didn't quite meet expectations. Winners Trump Trump defied all expectations, even some of the more conservative-leaning estimates of the 2024 election. By notable margins, Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in several key battleground states, being projected by the Fox News Decision Desk to win the election by amassing the necessary 270 electoral votes before a number of other top swing states had been called. Republicans Trump's top of the ticket projected victory was followed by significant victories for Republicans across the board. Senate Republicans were projected by the Fox News Decision Desk to retake the majority in the Senate in 2025, racking up wins in West Virginia, Ohio and Montana, which were previously blue. There are still multiple outstanding Senate races in swing states, giving the party hope for an even larger majority. Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes is projected to survive her closely watched re-election bid by defeating her GOP challenger. The Associated Press called the race for Ohio's 13th Congressional District for Sykes over former Ohio state Sen. Kevin Coughlin on Wednesday just before 3 p.m. ET. Sykes, a first-term Democrat who won in 2022 by five points, was defending her seat in a district that includes parts of two counties that former President Trump comfortably won in 2020. 'This is as 50/50 of a district as it comes,' Sykes said. 'It has been rated as such all across the country and there are all eyes on Ohio's 13th Congressional District.' Sykes comes from a well-established political family in Akron. Both her parents served as state lawmakers and her father, Vernon Sykes, currently serves as a state senator in Ohio. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images Rep. Normal Torres, is projected to win reelection the U.S. House, according to a call by the Associated Press. Torres defeated Republican challenger Mike Cargile in the race for California's 35th Congressional District. Torres has served in Congress since 2015 and previously served in the California State House an Assembly from 2008-2014. The call comes as the balance of power in the House of Representatives is still up for grabs, with the Fox News Decision Desk projecting that Republicans currently have a lead in the race to maintain their majority, though the Decision Desk has yet to call the race for the GOP. The Justice Department is looking to wind down two federal criminal cases against President-elect Donald Trump as he prepares to be sworn in to a second term in the White House- a decision that upholds longstanding policy that prevents Justice Department attorneys from prosecuting a sitting president. In making this argument, Justice Department officials cited a memo from the Office of Legal Counsel filed in 2000, which upholds a Watergate-era argument that asserts it is a violation of the separation of powers doctrine for the Justice Department to investigate a sitting president. It further notes that such proceedings would 'unduly interfere in a direct or formal sense with the
