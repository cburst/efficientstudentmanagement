Kamala Harris conceded to Donald Trump in the presidential race on Wednesday, both in a private phone call and in a public speech at Howard University. She spoke for about 12 minutes, offering the usual elements of a concession speech - praising her family, her campaign and her supporters - and acknowledging her loss. It was both gracious and, as Anderson Cooper said on CNN, 'defiant in many ways.' It also included eight words more important than any others, and ones that didn't get enough attention after she was done: 'We must accept the results of this election.' Plain, simple, obvious. And yet in the current landscape, sadly essential. Because let's face it, in normal times she wouldn't even need to say this. It's a given. These are not, of course, normal times. Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle. Harris went on to say that the administration will engage in a peaceful transfer of power. 'A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election,' she said, 'we must accept the results.' Someone remind Donald Trump. And Fox News, while you're at it. While that network's panel whined about Harris not having Joe Biden around, or something (it was hard to tell what the exact complaint was) and Brit Hume dustily scoffed that her speech was 'not particularly memorable,' they conveniently ignored the obvious: Trump never conceded the 2020 election, and continues to lie about its results. The hypocrisy is galling, the disdain for the audience's memory and awareness breathtaking. Yes, Trump won back the presidency, but the damage to the institution is done. Say so. CNN's Kaitlan Collins got it. 'Hearing her emphasize that line about a peaceful transition of power, it makes you realize she is affording to Trump what he never afforded to the incoming Biden-Harris administration,' she said. Quite the opposite, in fact. Trump egging on supporters to attack the U.S. Capitol to interrupt the certification of the 2020 election is still unthinkable, an affront to democracy. Yet somehow it's become almost a footnote to an administration that had disdain for the institutions of power. And, of course, Trump didn't stick around for Biden's inauguration, leaving town that morning. For what it's worth, Biden called Trump on Wednesday to congratulate him on his win and invited him to the White House, and has said he will be at the inauguration. Trump has called Biden 'Sleepy Joe' and called Harris worse, but some things you do because you're supposed to do them. Have we forgotten all this? Is this where we've landed? In a place where conducting yourself with the bare minimum of civility and decent behavior is notable, almost remarkable? Evidently. The last four years, for all of the bizarre drama of the last five months of the election season, were a return to normalcy in terms of the presidency. Normal isn't boring, it's just normal. Sure, setting a car on fire attracts the fire department and the TV news crews. But it's not an effective way to get to work. Now that Trump is returning to power, is there any reason to believe that his next administration will be any less chaotic than the first? Not if his campaign, with its racist, misogynistic trappings, is any indication. Trump will make news. He'll make sure of that. Maybe that's why Harris' speech, while fiery in its own way, felt like a throwback, a last gasp of normalcy. Enjoy it while it lasts. Opinion:TV news is awash in election post-mortems.
