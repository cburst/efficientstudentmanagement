Palm Beach early Wednesday. The 78-year-old Republican will become the first president in more than 130 years to win non-consecutive terms. Trump will also be the first convicted felon to win the White House, though his victory will likely give him new legal protections in four separate criminal cases against him. Harris' remarkably short presidential campaign began after Democrats forced Biden from the ticket following a disastrous June debate performance against Trump. Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris in July. A native Californian who served as San Francisco's district attorney and the attorney general, voters elected Harris to represent the state as a senator beginning in 2017. Shortly after, Harris ran for President in the 2020 race but she dropped out before primary voting began. Following Biden's decision to drop out of the race in July, Trump pivoted to attacking Harris, criticizing her record on immigration and tying her to inflation that took place under Biden's administration. On Wednesday, Biden separately spoke with both Harris and Trump. The president congratulated Harris on her historic campaign and Trump on his victory. He invited Trump to meet in the White House and expressed the importance of uniting the country. Biden plans to address the nation on Thursday and discuss the transition.
