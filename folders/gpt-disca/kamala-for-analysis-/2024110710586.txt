'Vice President Kamala Harris's historic candidacy inspired millions and her vision for a better future for all Americans will endure. Her advocacy on many issues - from lower costs, more affordable housing, and a fairer tax system- will continue to have strong impacts on America and on our party,' Schumer said in a statement. 'As we await the final tallies in elections across the country, Senate Democrats remain committed to our values and to working with our Republican colleagues to deliver for the American people,' he added. Schumer noted the only way to get things done in the Senate is through bipartisan legislation while maintaining its principles. 'The next two years will be no different,' he said.

In his first remarks after her election loss to President-elect Trump, Biden said Harris ran a 'historic campaign that embodied what's possible when guided by a strong moral compass and a clear vision for a nation that is more free, more just, and full of more opportunities for all Americans.' 'As I've said before, selecting Kamala was the very first decision I made when I became the nominee for president in 2020. It was the best decision I made,' he said. 'Her story represents the best of America's story. And as she made clear today, I have no doubt that she'll continue writing that story.' He added that Harris will continue to be a champion for all Americans and lead for generations as she 'puts her stamp on America's future.'
