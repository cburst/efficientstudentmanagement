As the dust settled on the 2024 election, Vice President Kamala Harris officially conceded the race to President-elect Donald Trump yesterday. Despite her attempts to make history as the first female president, Harris was unsuccessful in denying Trump a second term, and announced the end of her campaign in Washington, D.C. Judgments on why and how Harris lost are already being issued, with blame being laid on figures in the campaign, President Joe Biden, and even the voters themselves. Newsweek contacted a representative of the Harris campaign for comment on this story via email. Looking for a new perspective, Newsweek asked artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT what it thought happened on Election Day, using the prompt: 'Explain why Vice President Kamala Harris lost the 2024 Election to former President Donald Trump. 'Give reasons for your answer, with reference to the Electoral College, turnout, the 2024 election campaign, the strengths and weaknesses of each candidate, and the issues that were most relevant to voters.' ChatGPT responded: 'Vice President Kamala Harris' loss to former President Donald Trump in the 2024 U.S. presidential election can be attributed to several key factors. 'Trump secured victory by flipping critical swing states that he had lost in 2020, notably Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Wisconsin. These states provided the necessary electoral votes to surpass the 270-vote threshold required for the presidency. His success in these battlegrounds was pivotal, as they were instrumental in determining the election outcome. 'The election witnessed high voter turnout across the nation. Trump's campaign effectively mobilized his base, particularly in rural and working-class areas, leading to increased participation among these demographics. Conversely, Harris struggled to generate comparable enthusiasm among key Democratic constituencies, including younger voters and certain minority groups, resulting in lower turnout in critical regions. 'Trump's campaign capitalized on economic concerns, emphasizing issues like inflation and immigration, which resonated with many voters. He also expanded his appeal to minority voters, notably among Latino and Black communities, which contributed to his broader coalition. 'In contrast, Harris's campaign faced challenges in clearly differentiating her platform from the previous administration's policies, leading to perceptions of continuity rather than change. Additionally, her messaging on economic policies did not sufficiently address the pressing concerns of working-class voters.' The chatbot also highlighted Trump's struggle with legal battles throughout the race, saying: 'Despite facing legal challenges and controversies, Trump demonstrated resilience and maintained a strong connection with his base. His messaging on economic issues and border security appealed to a broad spectrum of voters, including some who had previously supported Democratic candidates. 'As the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket, Harris's candidacy was historic. However, she faced difficulties in connecting with working-class voters and articulating a distinct vision separate from the Biden administration. Her campaign also struggled to effectively counter misinformation and address concerns about economic policies, which undermined her appeal in key demographics.'
