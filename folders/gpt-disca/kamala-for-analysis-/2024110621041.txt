By Patrick Hipes Executive Managing Editor Vice President Kamala Harris will give her concession speech after losing the 2024 presidential election overnight, when Donald Trump officially clinched a second term by going over the 270 electoral votes needed for victory. She is expected to address supporters at Howard University at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET today, with coverage expected across broadcast and cable news networks after a long night of following returns. Howard, her Washington, D.C.-based alma mater, is where her supporters had been gathered Tuesday with the hopes of celebrating her victory. That didn't happen, with Trump outperforming his 2016 vote results especially in key battleground states, taking Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and North Carolina before sealing the victory when Wisconsin was called for him overnight. Watch Harris' speech above (It starts at the 24'30' mark.) In her call with Trump today, Harris formally conceded, according to media reports and the Trump campaign. Said Trump campaign communications director Steven Cheung:, 'President Donald J. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris spoke by phone earlier today where she congratulated him on his historic victory. President Trump acknowledged Vice President Harris on her strength, professionalism, and tenacity throughout the campaign, and both leaders agreed on the importance of unifying the country.' President Joe Biden followed with a similar call, inviting Trump to the White House. Biden is expected to address the country on Thursday. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.
