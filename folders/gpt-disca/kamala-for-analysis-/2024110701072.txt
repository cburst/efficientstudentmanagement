leader seeks continued U.S. support for his country's war against Russia. Zelenskyy, in a post on X, said he had an 'excellent call' with Trump and 'congratulated him on his historic landslide victory,' adding that 'his tremendous campaign made this result possible.' 'I praised his family and team for their great work,' Zelenskyy said. 'We agreed to maintain close dialogue and advance our cooperation. Strong and unwavering U.S. leadership is vital for the world and for a just peace.' The Biden administration has pumped billions of dollars in military support into Ukraine two and a half years after Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of the neighboring country. But future U.S. aid for Ukraine is in doubt after the election of Trump, who has a history of flattering statements about Putin and would not say during a September presidential debate whether he wants Ukraine to win the war. -Joey Garrison Former House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., issued a statement Wednesday acknowledging Trump's victory and committing to a peaceful transfer of power. 'We all pray for America's success under the next Administration,' she said. 'The peaceful transfer of power is the cornerstone of our democracy. After every election, we all have a responsibility to come together and find common ground.' - Riley Beggin Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-V.T., blasted the Democratic Party for its presidential and Senate election losses on Tuesday night, arguing that it had moved away from its roots supporting America's middle and lower class. 'It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them,' said Sanders, the most prominent progressive lawmaker in Congress. He mentioned concerns about access to healthcare, automation eliminating blue-collar jobs and the war in Israel. The strong rebuke comes after Sanders endorsed President Joe Biden, and then Vice President Kamala Harris as the party's nominee earlier this year. When Harris unveiled her economic plan earlier this year, Sanders said he was 'impressed,' and called it 'an excellent start.' Sanders did not mention either Harris or Biden in his statement, instead targeting it at the party's infrastructure. 'Will the big money interests and well-paid consultants who control the Democratic Party learn any real lessons from this disastrous campaign?' Sanders questioned. 'Do they have any ideas as to how we can take on the increasingly powerful Oligarchy which has so much economic and political power? Probably not.' - Karissa Waddick Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday conceded the 2024 election, promising a peaceful transfer of power. 'The outcome is not what we hoped for, worked for or voted for, but the light of America's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting,' Harris said during a concession speech at Howard University, her alma mater, in Washington, D.C. 'The fight for our country is always worth it.' 'I am so proud of the campaign we ran,' Harris told the crowd, to enthusiastic applause. Harris called on young people to continue to fight to make the 'world a better place' while vowing to continue her fight for the freedoms she laid out during her campaign, including abortion rights and gun control. 'While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign,' she said. 'We will continue to wage this fight in the voting booth, in the courts and in the public square, and we will also wage it in quieter ways, in how we live
