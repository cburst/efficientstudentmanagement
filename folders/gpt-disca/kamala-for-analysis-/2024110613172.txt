Nearly half - 45% - of all voters said they were worse off financially than they were four years ago. That was a higher level of dissatisfaction than what registered in exit polls in any recent election going back to 2008, when the election took place amid the financial crisis that propelled Barack Obama to victory. And though the economy is growing, with a low jobless rate and a booming stock market, 2 in 3 voters rated the U.S. economy poorly, a level higher than in 2020, when the country struggled to get in gear during the Covid pandemic. Harris and Trump ran very different campaigns, with Harris promising to work with people who disagreed with her, while Trump warned about 'the enemy within.' Besides abortion rights, she emphasized preserving democratic norms and tackling housing costs and other bread-and-butter economic issues. Harris refused to be drawn into spats with Trump, when for example he questioned whether she had downplayed her identity as a Black woman. Harris' mother came to the United States from India while her father is from Jamaica. Trump characterized Harris as a socialist, though she has a more centrist record, and insulted her intelligence and her qualifications. Harris was San Francisco's district attorney and California's attorney general before becoming a U.S. senator. Biden tapped her as his running mate after she ended her own campaign for president in 2020. But as part of the Biden administration, Harris struggled with other issues - the war in Gaza was the main one - over which she alienated many traditional Democratic voters. By contrast, Trump presented a dark vision of America, and one that fact checkers found filled with exaggerations and inaccuracies. He called migrants 'vermin' and charged they were committing violent crimes, made wild accusations about schools helping transgender schools transition without their parents' consent, and repeated his false claims that he, not Biden, had won the 2020 presidential election. Late in the campaign, a comedian at his Madison Square Garden rally insulted Puerto Ricans with a 'floating island of garbage' punchline. Trump has been found guilty of illegally influencing the 2016 election by making hush payments to a porn actress. He faces federal charges over his efforts to remain in the White House after the 2020 election and state charges in Georgia. The Associated Press contributed to this story.
