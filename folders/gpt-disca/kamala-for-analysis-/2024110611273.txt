that will continue to suffer,' Mubarak explained. 'But the people have spoken, and this is a message that they will no longer continue to vote for a cleaner dirty shirt.' Nellis, the former Harris adviser, stressed that, to be successful in future presidential races, Democrats must ask themselves, 'What are the things about us that we can change?' The condensed nature of Harris's campaign did not help, Nellis said, but Democrats need to think about the voters they left behind. That includes demographics commonly associated with the Republican Party. 'I want to have a serious conversation about how we're talking to and trying to bring back non-college-educated white men. I want to talk about rural voters. I want to talk about going into hostile spaces and trying to win folks back,' he said. Most urgently, he added, 'We need to be mobilising to fight back and try to stop some of the worst things that Trump is going to want to do.' With Harris defeated, Brown, the Georgetown University professor, predicts the US will not see the groundswell of protest that greeted Trump's first win in 2016. In 2017, the day after Trump was inaugurated, thousands of women flooded the streets in Washington, DC, and other cities with pink hats and feminist slogans. Activists around the country organised anti-Trump 'resistance' campaigns. Brown said that there may be some protests this year, though likely not to that scale. 'I've been doing focus groups with Black women who are the most reliable Democratic voters, and what they're sharing is that they are just exhausted. They are fatigued. They are burned out,' said Brown. Protesting Trump, she added, has become 'less safe'. More than 180 people, for example, were arrested for protesting Trump's inauguration, and some were charged with felony rioting - though many of those charges were later dropped. But Trump has promised vengeance against critics and opponents, and many fear that the repression of dissent will be far harsher this time around. 'There are going to be some people who will figure out ways to resist,' Gillespie at Emory University said. 'The big question is, how will Trump respond? Does he respond with repression?' Vigil of Boston University pointed to recent decisions by two leading national newspapers to cancel their Harris endorsements as evidence that even the powerful fear a Trump backlash. 'Unfortunately there is a fear that has become [almost] pervasive among business owners, among reporters, among everyday people,' Vigil said. Trump, she noted, has called his domestic adversaries 'the enemy within' - and threatened military intervention against them. 'All that speaks to the motion towards fascism that Harris was right about,' Vigil said. That, in turn, threatens to dampen any protest. 'People not only are tired and worn out and figure it doesn't matter any more, but if we don't see those kinds of rallies, I think there's going to be a fear element to it as well.'
